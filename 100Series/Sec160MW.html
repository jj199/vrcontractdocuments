</p>
<p>
    The Works under this Contract shall be undertaken in accordance with a
    Quality Management System that meets the requirements of relevant AS/NZS
    ISO Standards. The Standards specified in this clause form part of this
    Specification. Copies are not included in this document.
</p>
<p>
    These Standards include:
</p>
<p>
    AS/NZS ISO 9001 Quality Management Systems - Requirements
</p>
<p>
    AS/NZS ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems - Specification with
    guidance for use
</p>
<p>
    AS/NZS 4801 OHS - Management Systems
</p>
<p>
    The Quality Systems shall demonstrate compliance with all relevant Acts and
    Regulations and the requirements of the Contract Specification.
</p>
<p>
    160.A2 QUALITY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
</p>
<p>
    Quality terms and definitions shall be as defined by the Australian
    Standard AS/NZS ISO 9000 Quality management systems - Fundamentals and
    vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
    Other definitions and terms shall be as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'accredited laboratory'</strong>
    or <strong>'accredited method'</strong> means a testing laboratory that,
    when performing tests required by VicRoads Standard Specification Sections,
    Codes of Practice and applicable test methods, meets the requirements of AS
    ISO/IEC 17025 and all test reports/certificates shall be endorsed in
    accordance with the AS ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for that laboratory.
    Testing laboratories shall comply with the resource requirements for
    competent testing personnel and appropriate supervision as required by AS
    ISO/IEC 17025.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: Accreditation bodies which are signatories to the International
    Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA) for testing laboratories can offer accreditation against the
    requirements of AS ISO/IEC 17025. A listing of ILAC signatories is
    available from the ILAC website (www.ilac.org). In Australia, the National
    Association of Testing Authorities (NATA, https://www.nata.com.au) is a
    signatory to the ILAC MRA.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>'</strong>
    <strong>inspection'</strong>
    means and incorporates measuring, testing or otherwise examining goods and
    services or works or materials (including, where appropriate, raw
    materials, components and intermediate assemblies) for determining
    conformity with the specified requirements.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <strong>'measuring'</strong>
    includes checking for line, level, dimensional accuracy and quantity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> 'test'</strong>
    includes taking of samples and specimens and preparation of materials and
    work for testing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> 'Hold Point'</strong>
    means those points beyond which the stated activity must not proceed
    without the Superintendent's approval to proceed. The Superintendent's
    approval to proceed beyond the Hold Point does not relieve the Contractor
    of responsibility for satisfactory execution or performance of the work.
</p>
<p>
    Hold Points are identified in the specification by the letters HP in the
    left margin and by bold text print or arise from a nonconformity.
</p>
<p>
    Text which is bold typed but not identified by the letters HP in the left
    margin does not reflect a Hold Point. Such text reflects specified
    obligations on the Contractor requiring the review or approval of the
    Superintendent. They are bold typed for ease of identification.
</p>

    <strong>PART D &#8209; PROGRAM AND PROGRESS</strong>
    <a name="_Toc473547627"></a>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    160.D1 CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
</p>
<p>
    (a) Interpretation
</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of this sub&#8209;clause, 'construction program' means a
    program in the format of an activity orientated, critical path network
    which shows how the Contractor proposes to complete the Works or any
    separable part of the Works within the period or by the respective dates
    for Practical Completion.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Construction Program Requirements
</p>
<p>
    (i) Minor Construction Contracts:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Before commencing work under the Contract, the Contractor shall supply
        to the Superintendent for review a construction program illustrating
        the planned sequence of work.
    </strong>
    The program shall be in bar chart form, including the principal activities
    to be undertaken and restraints clearly identified with a time scale shown
    in weeks and months. The program shall identify critical path activities,
    include dates for starting and completion of the principal activities and
    planned dates for practical completion of the Works or separable parts as
    well as any requirements listed in the specification and Contract. Items
    (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this clause shall apply as far as they are
    applicable.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Utility Service Relocation
</p>
<p>
    In developing the construction program, the Contractor shall consider all
    issues associated with the relocation of public utility services. The
    Contractor shall fully inform itself of the impact of the works under the
    Contract on existing services and make allowance in its construction
    program for the lead times required by each service authority for design,
    liaison, supply of materials, notification to residents and construction
    periods, including making allowance for any periods of the year when
    services cannot be relocated.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall consider the impacts of its Service Relocation
    Strategy in the development of its construction program.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Review of Submitted Program
</p>
<p>
    (i) If the Superintendent considers that the submitted construction program
    or any subsequent revision thereto does not show sufficient details, or is
    impractical, or does not comply with the requirements of the Contract, or
    will not result in completion of the Works or any separable part of the
    Works by the relevant Date for Practical Completion, the Superintendent may
    direct the Contractor to resubmit to the Superintendent an amended
    construction program within 5 business days for further review.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Should the submitted construction program provide for completion of
    the Works or a separable part of the Works in advance of the relevant times
    for Practical Completion and the Superintendent does not direct the
    Contractor to supply an amended construction program, the Contractor may
    proceed to prosecute the work in accordance with the submitted construction
    program at the Contractor's own risk. The dates for particular activities
    or Practical Completion shown on a construction program will not be
    accepted as a substitute for any corresponding specified dates in the
    Contract which shall continue to be the basis for assessment of progress of
    work and any claims made under the Contract for extensions of time and
    additional costs.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Review of Progress
</p>
<p>
    At generally monthly intervals unless otherwise agreed, the Contractor and
    the Superintendent shall together review the progress of the work under the
    Contract in comparison with the current construction program. Prior to the
    meeting, the Contractor shall update the current construction program to
    show the status and progress of work on each activity. Progress shall be
    recorded by means of actual start and actual finish dates for activities,
    together with percentage completion and/or remaining duration of incomplete
    activities.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    The review of progress will be conducted as a site meeting between
    representatives of VicRoads and the Contractor held generally monthly, or
    at shorter intervals as decided by the Superintendent. Reviews held as site
    meetings shall be chaired by the Superintendent or the Superintendent's
    representative and minutes shall be prepared by the Superintendent and
    distributed to the Contractor within 10 business days of the meeting.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Updating and Reporting on Construction Program
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall maintain a complete record of the construction program
    and its changes on CD/DVD and in hardcopy, throughout the contract.
</p>
<p>
    (i) The Contractor shall submit to the Superintendent updated construction
    programs:
</p>
<p>
    1. at intervals not exceeding 3 months during the Contract; or
</p>
<p>
    2. within 10 business days of any change to the critical path for the Works
    or any separable part of the Works.
</p>
<p>
    3. within 5 business days of a request to do so from the Superintendent
    including, if applicable, an explanation in writing of delays in execution
    of the work under the Contract in comparison with the construction program.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Updated construction programs shall provide the same level of detail
    as the original Construction Program and shall:
</p>
<p>
    1. show the 'as&#8209;constructed' program in respect of all work carried
    out to the time of updating;
</p>
<p>
    2. be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for any changes from the
    previously submitted Construction Program;
</p>
<p>
    3. incorporate all extensions of time which have previously been granted or
    allowed up to that time by the Superintendent pursuant to the General
    Conditions of Contract;
</p>
<p>
    4. be accompanied by a statement of any claims for extensions of time which
    have previously been notified by the Contractor in accordance with the
    General Conditions of Contract in respect of which the Superintendent is
    yet to determine.
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Any updated construction program submitted in accordance with (i)
    above shall be reviewed by the Superintendent on the basis set out in item
    (c) above.
</p>
<p>
    (f) Rate of Progress
</p>
<p>
    Where the Superintendent at any time considers that the rate of progress is
    insufficient to ensure completion of the Works or any separable part of the
    Works by the relevant Date for Practical Completion, the Superintendent may
    direct the Contractor to submit within 10 business days written details of
    the intended procedure for the execution of the remainder of the work under
    the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    (g) Failure to Submit Construction Program
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contract requires the Contractor to provide to the Superintendent
    a construction program, no payment will be made to the Contractor until the
    Contractor has furnished to the Superintendent a Construction Program that
    accords with the requirements of the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    160.D2 ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS
</p>
<p>
    Time lost due to adverse weather conditions is defined for the purpose of
    this Contract as time lost due to wet weather, fog, excessively hot,
    excessively cold and/or dangerously windy conditions and to the effects of
    these adverse weather conditions, e.g. wet site conditions following rain.
</p>
<p>
    The Contract period includes the following allowance for time lost due to
    adverse weather conditions:
</p>
<p>
    ## (insert number of working days where applicable and strikethrough
    inapplicable alternatives):
</p>
<p>
    *** Whole of Works - ##: 'working' days
</p>
<p>
    *** Separable Part A - ##: 'working' days
</p>
<p>
    ***<strong> </strong>Separable Part B - ##: 'working' days<strong></strong>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    *** This allowance ##: includes / does not include allowance for periods
    when works are suspended due to adverse weather. This allowance is included
    in the Contract duration and is not to be construed as the actual time lost
    due to adverse weather conditions likely to be encountered during the
    Contract. The Contractor is deemed to have made all necessary inquiries as
    to adverse weather.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor's site representative shall notify the Superintendent
    immediately of any time lost due to adverse weather conditions and shall
    confirm such notification in writing within 5 business days. This
    confirmation shall provide details of the nature and extent of delays and
    the construction activities affected. The Superintendent, if satisfied that
    the Contractor has taken reasonable steps to minimize the period of delay,
    will certify at the end of each month an appropriate period of time lost
    and will issue to the Contractor a monthly summary of certified time lost.
    The maximum period of time which will be certified on any working day will
    be ten hours.
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contractor is required to provide a construction program, only
    delays affecting critical activities will be considered as time lost due to
    adverse weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
    If the total period of time certified exceeds the total allowance for the
    Whole of Works or applicable Separable Part of Works specified above, the
    Superintendent will, in accordance with the General Conditions of Contract,
    grant an extension of time for completion of the Whole of Works or
    applicable Separable Part of Works on the basis of 1 working day for each
    ten hours of certified time in excess of the allowance. No extension of
    time will be granted until the total excess period equals ten hours or a
    multiple thereof. Periods of less than ten hours' duration shall accrue to
    form part of any subsequent extension of time.
</p>
<p>
    No additional payment for costs arising from extensions of time granted due
    to excess adverse weather will be made.
</p>
<p>
    160.D3 WORKING HOURS

    160.G4 ACTIONS IN RESPECT OF INCIDENTS
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall take immediate steps to minimise the extent of
    personal injury or property damage arising from an Incident. The Contractor
    shall endeavour to take careful note of the evidence surrounding the
    Incident, including notes or reports of the facts relating thereto and
    photographs.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall, as soon as practicable, inform the Corporation and
    the VMIA in writing of any Incident that may give rise to a claim under an
    insurance policy effected as required by any of the insurance clauses or
    effected by the Corporation under the Contract and shall ensure that the
    Superintendent is kept fully informed of the Incident, the subsequent
    action and developments concerning the claim.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall take such steps as are necessary or appropriate to
    ensure that a sub-contractor shall, in respect to an event or claim of a
    like nature arising out of or relating to the operations or
    responsibilities of the sub-contractor, take in relation to the
    Superintendent the like action to that which the Contractor is required to
    take under this clause.
</p>
<p>
    Where the Incident is reportable to the VMIA under its Policy (which
    excludes registered vehicles), the Contractor shall, at its own expense, in
    accordance with Policy conditions:
</p>
<p>
    (a) notify the VMIA immediately -
</p>
<p>
    (1) by telephone if the matter is sufficiently serious to alert the VMIA
    and seek advice
</p>
<p>
    (2) in writing, with a copy to the Superintendent
</p>
<p>
    and preserve any evidence, such as notes or photographs;
</p>
<p>
    (b) send to the VMIA immediately upon receipt any letter of demand, writ,
    claim, summons or proceedings or other like documentation;
</p>
<p>
    (c) co&#8209;operate at its own cost with the VMIA in the investigation and
    defence of claims, including attendance at court if required.
</p>
<p>
    160.G5 MONTHLY REPORTING
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall report monthly to the Superintendent on all incidents
    included in the Incident Reporting System, including details of which

    report) and the status of resolution of each Incident.
</p>
<p>
    160.G6 AUDITING OF INCIDENT REPORTING SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall permit the Superintendent, staff of the VMIA, its
    auditors or any other auditors approved by the Superintendent to access and
    audit the Incident Reporting System and any documentation associated with
    claims or relating to Incidents or near Incidents and to take copies of any
    documents associated with claims or relating to the Incidents.
</p>
<p>
    160.G7 GENERAL
</p>
