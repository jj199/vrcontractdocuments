</p>
<p>

    (a) Effective Value (EV)
</p>
<p>
    The effective value in respect of each progress payment or final payment is
    the value of work included in the payment schedule, less:
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the value of any work included therein on the basis of actual cost
    or current prices;
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the value of any work which is not subject to rise and fall
    adjustment in accordance with Clause 199.03;
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the value of any work which is subject to rise and fall adjustment
    on a different basis from that provided in this section;
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the effective value of previous progress payments;
</p>
<p>
    and disregarding any previous increase or decrease in costs assessed under
    this section.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Adjustment Factor (F)
</p>
<p>
    F is the adjustment factor for the type of contract concerned (refer to
    Clause 199.07, Schedule of Details).
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (c) Construction Index Number
</p>
<p>
    The Construction Index Number is the Index published in the Australian
    Bureau of Statistics publication
    <em>
        Catalogue No. 6427, Producer Price Indexes, Table 17, 3101 Road and
        Bridge Construction Victoria
    </em>
    . In respect of index numbers published by the Australian Bureau of
    Statistics (ABS), the first published index number, whether or not it is
    described as 'preliminary', shall be used and no re&#8209;calculation shall
    be made on the basis of any subsequent revisions to the index number.
</p>
<p>
    The above ABS index is published quarterly. For the purpose of calculating
    rise and fall payments, VicRoads will adopt, to two decimal places, a
    monthly index based on the third points of a linear interpolation between
    the published quarterly indices. The Construction Index Number so adopted
    shall apply across the whole of the month to which it refers.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Base Construction Index Number
</p>
<p>
    Is the Index Number of the month preceding the month in which tenders
    close.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Current Construction Index Number
</p>
<p>
    Is the Index Number applicable for the month immediately preceding the
    month during which the work is performed, or where the work, other than
    maintenance activities during the defects period, is undertaken more than
    one month following the Date of Practical Completion then it is the month
    in which the Date of Practical Completion falls.
