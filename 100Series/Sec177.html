        to the sourcing, transport, storage and use of the non-potable water.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall meet the following requirements, and include
        appropriate measures to meet these requirements in the Environmental
        Improvement Plan:

        (b) Work in/near Waters
    </p>
    <p>
        Works shall be programmed and managed to avoid work in waters. Where
        work in waters is unavoidable, procedures shall be developed and
        implemented to satisfy the requirements of the specification and as
        required by any permits from the responsible authority(s).
    </p>
    <p>
        Where construction activities are undertaken in, near or over waters,
        the EMP shall address the protection of beneficial uses in accordance
with any permit, the        <em>State Environmental Planning Policy (Waters of Victoria)</em> and
        best practice guidelines.

        (c) Sedimentation Basins
    </p>
    <p>
        Sedimentation basins shall be utilised as the primary sediment control
        for the works unless the Contractor can demonstrate to the
        Superintendent's satisfaction that the implementation of a
        sedimentation basin is not technically feasible for the works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Where sedimentation basins are proposed as control measures, basins
        shall be designed to contain flows from a rainfall event having an
        Average Recurrence Interval of not less than two years and six hours
        duration when allowing for a 30% reduction in capacity as a result of
        sediment accumulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sedimentation basins shall be modelled and sized to manage rainfall
        intensities and soil characteristics specific to the region and for any
        material that is imported to the site. The sizing and modelling of
        sedimentation basin(s) shall consider the expected works and associated
        area of disturbance within catchment area(s) within the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sizing and modelling of temporary sedimentation basins shall be
undertaken using recognised 'best practice' modelling techniques or '        <em>VicRoads Temporary Sedimentation Basin Design Tool</em>'.
    </p>
    <p>
        Spillways shall be designed for an event having an Average Recurrence
        Interval of five years.

    <p>
        An independent hydraulic consultant who has demonstrated competence and
        suitable experience in the design of temporary sedimentation basins
        shall complete and sign a declaration in accordance with Attachment C
        to this Section 177. The declaration shall accompany submission of the
        sedimentation basin designs to the Superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            HP The Contractor shall submit to the Superintendent the
            sedimentation designs and the associated independent verification
            declarations not less than two weeks prior to the commencement of
            construction of the temporary sedimentation basin.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Sedimentation basins shall be cleaned out whenever the accumulated
        sediment has reduced the capacity of the basin by 30% or more, or
        whenever the sediment has built up to a point where it is less than 500
        mm below the spillway crest, whichever occurs earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall maintain the capacity of the sedimentation basin
        and shall ensure compliance with Clause 177.B1(b)(ii) if dewatering to
        a waterway.
    </p>
    <p>
        (d) Stockpiles
    </p>
    <p>
        Where soil is stockpiled on site, such stockpiles shall be located,
        where possible, to provide a clearance of not less than 10 m from
        waterways. Where it is not possible to provide a clearance of 10 m, the
        stockpile shall be above the normal high water level of the waterways
        and additional protection shall be provided to prevent the stockpiled
        material entering the waterways.
    </p>
    <p>
        (e) Monitoring
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall inspect the whole site for instances of soil
        erosion or scour and the effectiveness of erosion and sedimentation
        controls:
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8226; at intervals not more than seven days;<strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8226; within one hour of the commencement of any runoff resulting
        from rain events during working hours;

    <p>
        &#8226; every four hours during periods of continuous rain during
        working hours;
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8226; within 12 hours of a rain event outside working hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any defects and/or deficiencies in control measures identified by
        monitoring undertaken shall be rectified immediately and these control
        measures shall be cleaned, repaired and augmented as required to ensure
        effective control.

    <p>
        The contractor shall undertake blast monitoring to ensure that blasting
        activities do not pose the potential for damage to surrounding
        buildings or structures and to minimise disturbance to the community.
    </p>

        set out in Table 177.H3.01; and

        use - Use of explosives), at locations relevant to sensitive buildings
