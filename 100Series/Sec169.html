</p>
<p>
    169.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for the construction of bridgeworks
    over, on or adjacent to railway property.
</p>
<p>
    169.02 APPROVAL TO PROCEED
</p>
<p>
    All work carried out on railway property shall be subject to the
    requirements of the Railway Maintenance Manager or other appropriate
    officer of the railway authority and it will be the responsibility of the

</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        No work shall be commenced over, on or adjacent to railway property
        without the permission of the Superintendent being obtained, and any
        such work shall continue only to the extent indicated by the
        Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    169.03 ACCESS
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent will arrange with the railway officer for adequate
    access to those portions of the railway property required so that the work
    may proceed without undue delay or hindrance.
</p>
<p>
    Access will be arranged in such areas and at such times as nearly as
    possible as the programme of works necessitates. In the event of any delay
    to the Contractor's operations being caused by access to the railway
    property not being available when needed, the Contractor will be entitled
    to claim an extension of time for completion beyond the specified dates of
    practical completion for the whole of the works or separable works,
    whichever is relevant.
</p>
<p>
    Such claims will be assessed by the Superintendent in accordance with the
    General Conditions of Contract.
</p>
<p>
    169.04 RAILWAY CLEARANCES
</p>
<p>
    In any work adjacent to existing rail tracks, the Contractor shall ensure
    that at all times formwork, staging, scaffolding, struts or stays shall
    conform to the limitations of the railway clearance diagram.
</p>
<p>
    169.05 INTERFERENCE AND LIABILITY
</p>
<p>
    All works on or adjacent to the railway property shall be carried out by
    the Contractor in such a manner as not to cause, or to be the cause of,
    interference or damage to any property or rolling stock or anything
    whatsoever belonging to the railway authority, and in such a manner as not
    to interfere in any way with the traffic or business of the railways or
    with any other work or contract that may be in progress on any railway line
    or premises.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        No railway premises or property shall on any account or for any reason
        or cause whatsoever be obstructed by the Contractor without the written
        permission of the Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall:
</p>
<p>
    (a) comply with all the by-laws, rules and regulations of the railway
    authority relevant to this contract and for the time being in force;
</p>
<p>
    (b) at his own cost provide all necessary watchmen (excluding the cost of
    railway authority flagmen), shoring, lights, barriers, fences and gangways,
    and properly maintain the same; and
</p>
<p>
    (c) take all other precautions which may be requisite for the convenience
    and safety of the public and the protection of life and property, or which
    may be required by the Superintendent in conjunction with the Railway
    Maintenance Manager or other appropriate officer.
</p>
<p>
    Railway authority officers may require that a railway flagman be employed
    at the site to ensure that the requirements of the specification are
    satisfied. The cost of the flagman will be borne by VicRoads, but
    liquidated damages for the contract have been assessed taking this cost
    into account.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Rubber-tyred machinery, other than motor vehicles, shall be required to
    stop before crossing the railway tracks, and only proceed if no trains are
    in sight, unless signalled to proceed by a railway authority flagman.
</p>
<p>
    All necessary precautions shall be taken to ensure that high loads do not
    foul overhead wires or cables when crossing tracks.
</p>
<p>
    Construction plant, such as cranes, excavators etc., shall be made
    stationary and aerial elements (booms, buckets etc.) grounded during the
    passage of a train.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall notify the Superintendent of any damage caused to the
    property of the railway authority during the progress of the work as a
    result of the Contractor's operations. If so directed by the
    Superintendent, the Contractor shall restore such property at his own
    expense to the condition which, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
    existed prior to the commencement of the Contractor's operations.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of any work or any property of the railway authority being
    damaged, it may be repaired by the railway authority and the cost of such
    repairs will be deducted by VicRoads from any moneys due, or which may from
    time to time become due, to the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be liable for the cost of any accident or any loss or
    damage whatsoever and to whomsoever which may occur or be occasioned on the
    premises of the railway authority through or owing to or in any way arising
    out of his neglect or misconduct or that of any of the persons in his
    employment or under his control.
</p>
<p>
    In the event of the Contractor's failure or neglect to carry out the works
    and provide, maintain and take all precautions in strict conformity with,
    and with due observance of the provisions herein contained, then, in every
    such case as often as the same shall occur, the Contractor will be held
    responsible and liable for any loss or damage whatsoever which in the
    judgement of the Superintendent shall have been sustained by the railway
    authority owing to any such failure or neglect by or on the part of the
    Contractor and the amount of any such loss or damage as assessed by the
    Superintendent may be deducted by VicRoads from any money due or which may
    become due to the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    169.06 CONSTRUCTION OF SPANS OVER RAILWAY LINES
</p>
<p>
    During the erection of spans over railway lines, the Contractor shall be
    responsible for taking all possible measures to ensure the safety of the
    workmen against risk of falling onto the tracks or being struck by trains,
    and likewise to protect the travelling public and the property of the
    railway authority from damage caused by materials falling or projecting
    from the new structure, or the staging used in its erection.
</p>
<p>
    For this purpose the following precautions shall be taken:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Traffic across the railway tracks at the site shall be kept to a
    minimum, and limited to a selected point where the visibility is
    unrestricted both up and down the tracks for a person at least 3 m back
    from either side of the track.
</p>
<p>
    Where it is necessary for material to be moved across the tracks the
    movement shall take place at times when the Contractor has confirmed that
    the tracks will be clear of rail traffic for a reasonable period.
</p>
<p>
    It will be the responsibility of the Contractor to ascertain the movement
    of trains on any particular day, and to regulate his operations
    accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    (b)
    <strong>
        The times at which superstructure components are placed over the rail
        track shall be subject to review by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (c) All parts of the overhead system, including conductors, contact wires,
    catenary wires, dropper arms, pull off arms, and any other overhead
    fittings, whether in service or newly erected, shall always be considered
    alive at 1500 volts and treated accordingly, unless definite instructions
    have been given in writing by the railway authority that such conductors
    wires and the like, are dead and earthed.
</p>
<p>
    Where workmen are carrying out work of any kind over or adjacent to the
    railway tracks, care must be exercised to avoid touching any part of the
    overhead system with any part of their body or clothing, or with any
    article which they may be carrying.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Metal tapes or metal reinforced tapes shall not be used in positions where
    they are likely to fall or be blown across any overhead conductors, wires,
    and any other overhead fittings, unless a "Permit to Work" has been
    obtained from the railway authority. Attention is also drawn to the danger
    of throwing or allowing paint, water or any other liquid, or materials such
    as rope, wire, etc., with which workmen or parts of the structure may be in
    contact, to fall on the overhead equipment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP No work shall be carried out on any portion of the structure over or
        adjacent to the railway tracks and in the proximity of the overhead
        electrical equipment except in the presence of a representative of the
        railway authority who is certified as qualified to distinguish between
        safe and unsafe conditions, and until a "Permit to Work" has been
        obtained.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The times shown on the "Permit to Work" shall be strictly adhered to, and
    the permit shall be returned by the Contractor to the railway authority not
    later than the time shown, whether the work is completed or not. The permit
    will then be cancelled and will be of no further value.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall apply to the Superintendent for the issue of a new
    permit for each and every period during which work will be carried out in
    places likely to be in dangerous proximity to the overhead electrical
    equipment.
</p>
<p>
    The cost of attendance of the necessary railway staff to provide
    protection, earth overhead wiring etc., will be borne by VicRoads.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        After the main beams or slabs have been erected, protective shields
        will be fitted over the overhead wiring by the railway authority
        without charge to the Contractor.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Work may then be permitted above the overhead wires in the "live"
        condition subject to the review by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the above, the Contractor shall take such additional
    precautions as may be required from time to time by the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    169.07 RAILWAY SIGNALLING AND COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall note that railway signalling and communication
    facilities exist on and adjacent to the site of the works, and shall carry
    out the work to avoid any interference with this equipment.
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent will arrange for any alterations required to such
    facilities during the contract without cost to the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall keep the rails free of any form of contact with
    metallic objects, as all tracks in the area control electric circuits of
    the signalling system. Metal tapes or metal reinforced CED tapes shall not
    be used across running tracks unless a piece of approved insulating
    material is placed between the tape and rails.
</p>
<p>
    Where a pathway or roadway is permitted over the rails, a ballast or
    bitumen roadway or timber panels shall be provided by the Contractor, and a
    thick coating of emulsified bitumen shall be applied to the sides and
    bottoms of the rails.
</p>
<p>
    The contractor shall use rubber tyred vehicles wherever possible to prevent
    fouling of the tracks and shorting of the track circuits.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Railway tracks shall not be crossed with steel wheeled or tracked
        construction plant without the permission of the Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Rail bonding and track circuit connections shall not be disturbed by the
    Contractor, and the railway authority shall be informed immediately if
    these connections are affected.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall not in any way cause any interference with the normal
    operation of any points or signal equipment in the works area. The points,
    signal wires and point rodding shall be kept free of any material or
    equipment.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out all works over or adjacent to the railway
    tracks in such a manner as not to cause interference to the view of any
    railway fixed signals of any train driver or crew.
</p>
<p>
    Any temporary lighting to protect the works shall be provided and
    positioned to avoid confusion with signals. White lights only shall be used
    for temporary lighting and placement shall be acceptable to the
    Superintendent.
</p>
