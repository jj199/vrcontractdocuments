        Laboratories that perform tests required by VicRoads Standard
        Specification Sections, Codes of Practice and applicable test methods
        shall meet the requirements of AS ISO/IEC 17025. All test reports shall
        be endorsed in accordance with the AS ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for
        that laboratory. Testing laboratories shall comply with the resource
        requirements for competent testing personnel and appropriate

<p>
    NOTE: Accreditation bodies which are signatories to the International
    Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA) for testing laboratories can offer accreditation against the
    requirements of AS ISO/IEC 17025. A listing of ILAC signatories is
available from the ILAC website (    <a href="http://www.ilac.org">www.ilac.org</a>). In Australia, the National
Association of Testing Authorities (NATA,    <a href="https://www.nata.com.au">https://www.nata.com.au</a>) is a
    signatory to the ILAC MRA.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: To conform with ILAC requirements, any additional tests may need to
    be covered by the terms of the accreditation or, if this is not the case,
    the testing may need to be reported such that it is clear the testing is
    not covered by accreditation. A separate report may be necessary.

    (b) personnel who have successfully completed an accredited course in
    sampling of construction materials delivered by a registered training
    organisation, and as necessary, have taken a refresher course in sampling
