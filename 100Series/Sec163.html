    <strong>PART A - QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong>
</p>
<p>
    163.A1 THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall plan, develop and maintain a documented quality
    management system in accordance with this Specification and with Australian
    Standard AS/NZS ISO 9001 'Quality management systems - Requirements' except
    for requirements of Clause 7.3 Design and Development.
</p>
<p>
    The quality management system shall cover all work under the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    163.A2 HOLD POINTS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong>
    Those points beyond which the work may not proceed without review by the
    Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
Hold points are identified in the specification by the letters    <strong>HP</strong> in the left margin and by bold text print or arise from
    non&#8209;conformances.
</p>
<p>
    The review by the Superintendent of a hold point will not relieve the
    Contractor of responsibility for satisfactory execution or performance of
    the work.
</p>
<p>
    Text which is bolded but not identified by the letters <strong>HP</strong>
    in the left margin is not a Hold Point. These are specified obligations on
    the Contractor requiring the review or approval of the Superintendent. They
    are bolded for ease of identification.
</p>
<p>
    163.A3 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOCUMENTS
</p>
<p>
    Further to the General Conditions of Contract, the Contractor shall submit
    for consideration by the Superintendent the following:
</p>
<p>
    (a) a controlled copy of the contract specific quality plan within four
    weeks of the date of acceptance of the tender, i.e. a document setting out
    the specific quality practices, resources, activities and responsibilities
    relevant to the Contract;
</p>
<p>
    (b) specific quality procedures/descriptions relating to the work not less
    than 14 days prior to the commencement of that work. However, for works
    proposed at the commencement of the Contract for which 14 days is not
    possible, a period of 4 working days will be accepted.
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>

<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    163.A4 ADDITIONAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall comply with the specified Australian Standard for
    quality management systems. In addition, the following requirements shall
    be satisfied:
</p>
<p>
    (a) For AS/NZS ISO 9001
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    All non&#8209;conformances, where the disposition of the
    non&#8209;conformance violates the contractual requirements, are to be
    promptly reported to the Superintendent for agreement via
    non&#8209;conformance reports. Such non&#8209;conformances automatically
    create hold points.
</p>
<p>
    Further, all non&#8209;conformance reports shall include:
</p>
<p>
    (i) the cause of the non&#8209;conformance;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the proposed method of rectifying the non&#8209;conformance; and
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the proposed changes made to the work procedures to prevent a
    recurrence.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Audits
</p>
<p>
    Audits carried out by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of the
    relevant quality management system standard shall be conducted by a
    qualified auditor in accordance with AS/NZS ISO 19011 'Guidelines for

    documentation, records and personnel, including those of any
    sub&#8209;contractors, that are reasonably required for audits to be
    undertaken.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding that VicRoads may have previously undertaken audits of a
    sub&#8209;contractor's quality management system in connection with other
    work, the Contractor shall include the operations of all such
    sub&#8209;contractors in the Contract quality plan and shall fulfil all the
    quality obligations of the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    VicRoads will carry out audit and surveillance of the work of all
    sub&#8209;contractors as it sees fit, in the same way that it may carry out
    audit and surveillance of all work done and materials supplied by the
    Contractor. The Superintendent may for this purpose have recourse to audit
    and surveillance carried out for other VicRoads contracts. Copies of any
    such audit and surveillance reports used by the Superintendent will be
    provided to the Contractor.

    'Published Rates' means the Rates and Cost Schedules for Tip Truck Owner
    Drivers developed by the Transport Industry Council.
</p>
<p>
    'Relevant Published Rate' means those of the Published Rates applicable to

</p>
<p>
    'Tip Truck Owner Driver' means an independent contractor who drives a tip
    truck in connection with excavation work in the building and construction
    industry.
</p>
<p>
    (a) If any aspect of the delivery of the Works or carrying out the work

    remaining provisions of this clause apply.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Whether the Contractor engages a Tip Truck Owner Driver directly or
    indirectly through a subcontractor, secondary subcontractor or Freight
    Broker, the Contractor must ensure that the Tip Truck Owner Driver is paid
    according to the following:
</p>
<p>
    (i) if the Tip Truck Owner Driver is to be paid at an hourly rate then that
    must be at least at the Relevant Published Rate plus any Freight Broker
    fees due and payable and road tolls reasonably incurred;
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (ii) if the Tip Truck Owner Driver is to be paid on a per load rate then
    the per load rate must be arrived at based on a reasonable estimate of the
    time likely to be required to complete the specific job, multiplied by the
    Relevant Published Rate adjusted for any agreed incentive component, plus
    any Freight Broker fees due and payable and road tolls reasonably incurred;
</p>
<p>
    -(iii) for the purposes of calculating a per load rate, a reasonable
    estimate of the time likely to be required must:

    distance to be travelled for transfer, local traffic conditions, time of
    day, expected waiting times, special site conditions and other special
    circumstances; and
</p>
<p>

    reasonable estimate;
</p>
<p>
    (iv) if a per load rate includes an incentive component in addition to the
    minimum rate, the incentive component may be reduced in proportion to any
    shortfall in the load moved, as agreed between the Tip Truck Owner Driver
    and the party engaging them;
</p>
<p>
    (v) where the parties agree that an adjustment applies to account for
    project specific requirements, then payments to the Tip Truck Owner Driver
    must be increased by the rate agreed by the parties; and
</p>
<p>
    (vi) if the Tip Truck Owner Driver is underpaid, the Contractor must either

    action and developments concerning the claim.
</p>

    Superintendent the like action to that which the Contractor is required to
    take under this clause.

    excludes registered vehicles), the Contractor shall, at its own expense, in

</p>
<p>
    and preserve any evidence, such as notes or photographs;
