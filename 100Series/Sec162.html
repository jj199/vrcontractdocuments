    <strong>PART A - QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    162.A1 THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall plan, develop and maintain a documented quality
    management system in accordance with this Specification and with an
    Australian Standard AS/NZS ISO 9001 'Quality management systems -
    Requirements' except for requirements of Clause 7.3 Design and Development.
</p>
<p>
    The quality management system shall cover all work under the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    162.A2 HOLD POINTS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong>
    Those points beyond which the work may not proceed without review by the
    Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
Hold points are identified in the specification by the letters    <strong>HP</strong> in the left margin and by bold text print or arise from
    non&#8209;conformances.
</p>
<p>
    The review by the Superintendent of a hold point will not relieve the
    Contractor of responsibility for satisfactory execution or performance of
    the work.
</p>
<p>
    Text which is bolded but not identified by the letters <strong>HP</strong>
    in the left margin is not a Hold Point. These are specified obligations on
    the Contractor requiring the review or approval of the Superintendent. They
    are bolded for ease of identification.
</p>
<p>
    162.A3 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOCUMENTS

    (a) a controlled copy of the contract specific quality plan within four
    weeks of the date of acceptance of the tender, i.e. a document setting out
    the specific quality practices, resources, activities and responsibilities
    relevant to the Contract;
</p>
<p>
    (b) specific quality procedures/descriptions relating to the work not less
    than 14 days prior to the commencement of that work. However, for works
    proposed at the commencement of the Contract for which 14 days is not
    possible, a period of 4 working days will be accepted.
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified quality plans are not required for annual supply
    contracts.
