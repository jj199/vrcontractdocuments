    Stabilised earthworks carried out in a boxed formation shall extend to the
    full width of the boxing. If there is no boxed formation, the edges of the
    stabilised material shall not be inside the specified offset from
    centreline or design line.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Width
</p>
<p>
    The width of the stabilised material shall not be less than the specified
    width.
</p>
<p>
    290.05 MATERIALS
</p>
<p>
    Materials supplied under the Contract shall comply with the following
    properties:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Lime
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Compaction plant shall be of such mass and configuration as to be capable
    of compacting the stabilised layer to the minimum density ratio throughout
    the entire depth of the stabilised layer.
</p>
<p>
    290.10 CONSTRUCTION
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    Construction includes the preparation of the earthworks formation,
    spreading of the stabilising binder, slaking of quicklime, mixing,
    compaction, trimming and curing of the stabilised material.
</p>
<p>
    The construction methodology shall include provision for how the
    requirements of clause 290.04 will be achieved.
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, stabilisation work undertaken each day shall be
    completed across the full pavement width.
</p>
<p>
    Stabilisation operations may continue during light rainfall if the moisture
    content of the in situ pavement material can be maintained below standard
    optimum moisture content.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    If it is proposed to stabilise the earthworks material with both lime and
    cement, simultaneous mixing of the stabilising binders is not permitted.
    Each stabilising binder shall be mixed in accordance with the specified
    requirements. The lime stabilised material shall be rolled with a smooth
    drum or wheeled roller to protect it from adverse weather, prior to it
    being cementitiously stabilised. The requirements of Clause 290.10(h) shall
    also apply.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP If Type GP is proposed, the Superintendent shall be first notified
        and evidence provided to show that the earthworks material can be mixed
        and compacted to the specified density within the Maximum Allowable
        Working Time for Type GP Cement.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Pre-treatment of Earthworks
</p>
<p>
    The material to be stabilised shall be pre-treated by scarifying or
    pulverising to the specified depth to provide an even surface capable of
    being trimmed to meet the requirements of clause 290.04. Any hard rock
    particles larger than 75 mm shall be removed from the scarified material.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Spreading of Stabilising Binder
</p>
<p>
    The spreading of the stabilising binder shall not be carried out at times
    when the binder could become air borne or dispersed in such a way as to
    become a nuisance or a hazard to persons, property or livestock.
</p>
<p>
If the required spreading rate for the stabilising binder exceeds 15 kg/m    <sup>2</sup>, it shall be spread in two equal spreading runs with material
    from the first spreader run being fully mixed into the material prior to
    the second spreading run being undertaken.
</p>
<p>
    Immediately following the completion of spreading of the stabilising
    binder, the Contractor shall check and record the Average Spreading Rates
    and the Uniformity of Spread in accordance with clause 290.13.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Spreading of Lime
</p>
<p>

<p>
    The minimum Design Content of Available Lime shall be 1.5% by mass as
    determined under RC 301.04. The 1.5% by mass minimum design content of
    Available Lime only applies when a design strength is being targeted and
    does not apply when lime stabilisation is being undertaken to only dry back
    material.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Slaking of Quicklime
</p>
<p>
    Quicklime shall be slaked with sufficient water to allow full hydration to
    take place. Full hydration will be deemed to have been achieved when all
    quicklime that has been spread has changed from a cream coloured granulate
    to a fine white powder and there is a cessation of rising vapours.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (f) Mixing of Lime Stabilised Material
</p>
<p>
    If quicklime is used, mixing shall not commence until full hydration has
    been achieved.
</p>
<p>
    All lime shall be mixed to the specified depth within six hours of
    spreading regardless of the number of spreading and mixing runs required.
    If lime stabilised material contains non-friable wet clay lumps with a
    nominal size in excess of 75 mm after the initial mixing run, the lime
    stabilised material shall be allowed to stand for up to 72 hours to allow
    sufficient time for clay lumps to dry out and react with the lime.
</p>
<p>
    Once the lime stabilised material is friable it shall be remixed prior to
    compaction. Remixing shall proceed until all stabilised material other than
    isolated hard rock particles up to a nominal size of 75 mm, is capable of
    passing a 37.5 mm sieve and a minimum of at least 60% is capable of passing
    a 9.5 mm sieve when shaken without forcing material through the openings.
    The stabilised material shall be visually inspected for uniform mixing by
    excavating test holes for the full depth of the loose material at six
    random locations within each compaction test lot as defined in clause
    290.14(a).
</p>
<p>
    The number of mixing runs undertaken after the completion of the spreading
    of lime shall not be less than two
</p>
<p>
    (g) Spreading and Mixing of Cementitious Stabilised Material
</p>
<p>
    The cementitious binder shall be spread uniformly over the prepared surface
    at the Design Distribution Rate of the cementitious binder.
</p>
<p>
    Mixing shall commence as soon as practical after spreading of the
    cementitious binder and shall continue until all the earthwork material and
    cementitious binder are uniformly blended throughout the full depth of the
    stabilised earthworks.
</p>
<p>
    The moisture content of the earthworks material prior to addition of the
    cementitious binder shall be within the range 80% to 100% of the optimum
    moisture content. Additional water shall be added to hydrate the
    cementitious binder.
</p>
<p>
    If it is proposed to stabilise the earthworks material with both lime and
    cement, simultaneous mixing of the stabilising binders is not permitted.
    Each stabilising binder shall be mixed in accordance with the specified
    requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The number of mixing runs undertaken after the completion of the spreading
    of the cementitious binder shall not be less than two.
</p>
<p>
    (h) Cementitious Stabilisation of Lime Stabilised Material
</p>
<p>
    Cementitious stabilisation of a lime stabilised material is permitted to
    commence the next calendar day after the completion of the mixing of the
    lime into the earthworks material.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the addition of cementitious binder, the requirements of clause
    290.10(b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall be met. Spreading and mixing of the
    cementitious stabilised material shall be undertaken in accordance with
    clause 290.10(g).
</p>
<p>
    The number of mixing runs undertaken after the completion of the spreading
    of the cementitious binder shall not be less than two.
</p>
<p>
    (i) Compaction
</p>
<p>
    Compaction of the stabilised layer shall commence immediately after mixing,
    but only after the requirements of clause 209.10(f) or (g) or (h), as
    appropriate, have been met.
</p>
<p>
    Compaction equipment shall work as close as practicable behind the mixer to
    maximise the time available for compaction. Compaction and trimming shall
    be carried out in a continuous operation.
</p>
<p>
    All compaction shall be completed within the times specified in Table
    290.101 after addition of the stabilising binder.
</p>
<p>
    If necessary during compaction, the Contractor shall water the material to
    maintain the moisture content within 80% to 100% of the stabilised
    material's optimum moisture content.

    (j) Maximum Layer Thickness
</p>
<p>
    The maximum compacted layer thickness for any stabilised material shall not
    exceed 250 mm, unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    (k) Trimming
</p>
<p>
    The surface may be further trimmed before or during compaction to meet the
    requirements of clause 290.04(a) and (c).
</p>
<p>
    On completion of initial rolling, the stabilised material shall be trimmed
    to the specified surface tolerances. Light applications of water may be
    applied during this operation to replace evaporated moisture and to assist
    in rapid achievement of a tightly knit surface.
</p>
<p>
    All surface irregularities which do not conform to the requirements of
    clause 290.04 shall be rectified by the Contractor within the maximum
    working time for the stabilising binder used as specified in Table 290.101.
</p>
<p>
    The material trimmed off shall be either cut to waste and if necessary,
    removed from site or, alternatively it may be transported to another
    location to be incorporated into a stabilised layer.
</p>
<p>
    290.11 PRELIMINARY TRIAL
</p>
<p>
    If specified in clause 290.17(c), the Contractor shall carry out a
    preliminary trial of the proposed stabilising operation.
</p>
<p>
    The trial shall determine the:
</p>
<p>
    (a) effectiveness of the construction plant
</p>
<p>
    (b) number of passes of the stabilisation machine necessary to achieve
    uniform pulverisation and mixing
</p>
<p>
    (c) field moisture content required to achieve the specified compaction
    requirements
</p>
<p>
    (d) rolling routine required to meet the specified compaction requirements
</p>
<p>
    (e) uniformity of mixing of six random test holes.
</p>
<p>
    The trial section shall be located within the Works area. If there are
    multiple earthwork material types being stabilised and/or different
    stabilising binders, separate trials will be required for each combination
    of material and stabilising binder.
</p>
<p>
    The length of each trial section shall be between 100 and 200 metres over
    the full width of the area proposed for stabilisation, or other length as
    approved by the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Stabilisation shall not proceed outside the trial sections until the
        Superintendent has reviewed all aspects of the work. If the
        Specification requirements are not met for the trial, the
        Superintendent may direct that another trial be undertaken or that the
        work be re&#8209;stabilised and presented for re&#8209;assessment.
    </strong>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    290.12 TEST ROLLING
</p>
<p>
    All stabilised material shall be test rolled in accordance with Section 173
    of the Specification. Any unstable areas detected by test rolling shall be
    rectified by the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    If the Superintendent considers that a completed stabilised earthworks
    layer has been affected by rain or damaged in some way before a successive
    layer is placed, further test rolling shall be carried out by the
    Contractor on the layer immediately prior to being covered by a succeeding
    layer.
</p>
<p>
    290.13 REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE OF STABILISING BINDER
    SPREADING RATE
</p>
<p>
    (a) Mat or Tray System
</p>
<p>
    The average spreading rate of stabilising binder shall be ascertained by
    dividing the mass of the binder used by the area over which the binder has
    been spread. If the average spreading rate is less than specified,
    additional binder shall be spread over the surface to bring the average
    spreading rate up to at least the specified rate. The Contractor shall
    check the uniformity of the spreading of the binder at the frequency
    specified in Table 290.151.
</p>
<p>
    The following procedure shall be used to determine the uniformity of the
    spreading rate:
</p>
<p>
    (i) place a minimum of three mats or trays with a plan area not less than 1
    m<sup>2</sup> in total, in the path of the spreading vehicle at an equal
    spacing of not less than 25% of the length of the spreading run;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) divide the mass of binder deposited on each mat or tray by the plan
    area of the mat or tray;
</p>
<p>
    (iii) if the binder spreading rate so determined for any mat or tray is
    less than the specified rate by more than 10%, additional binder shall be
    spread over the part or all of the area over which the binder has been
    spread.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall check the uniformity of the spreading of lime at the
    frequency specified in Table 290.131 by placing a minimum of three mats or
    trays with a plan area not less than 1 m<sup>2</sup> in the path of the
    spreading vehicle at an equal spacing of not less than 25% of the length of
    the spreading run. The Lime Spreading Rate over each mat or tray shall be
    calculated by dividing the mass of lime deposited on each mat or tray by
    the plan area of the mat or tray. Where the Lime Spreading Rate so
    determined for any mat or tray is less than the specified rate by more than
    10%, additional lime shall be spread over the part or all of the area over
    which the lime has been spread.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Continuous Weighing System
</p>
<p>
    The mass of the stabilising binder spread over the surface may be measured
    and recorded by a spreader fitted with a fully calibrated computerised
    electronic weigh scale system capable of continuously measuring and
    recording the mass of binder at intervals of not more than 100 m of forward
    travel. If requested by the Superintendent, the Contractor shall produce
    the print out of the actual binder spreading rate.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall have a current certificate of calibration for the
    computerised spreading equipment and shall produce evidence of the actual
    running spread rate when requested by the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    290.14 REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCEPTANCE OF COMPACTION AND MATERIAL
</p>
<p>
    (a) Lot Testing Requirements
</p>
<p>
    If Scale A or B compaction standard is specified in Table 290.171,
    compaction is to be accepted by density testing in lots of similar material
    and work. Unless otherwise specified, the maximum lot size shall be the
    area of work completed on the same day up to 4,000 m<sup>2</sup> provided
    that the whole of the lot is essentially a uniform material similar to
    material used for the relevant mix design applicable to the lot.
</p>
<p>
    If the maximum binder working time requires a lot to be completed over
    multiple days, each daily sub-section shall be treated as a separate lot.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    If the material is too variable to be able to assign a single maximum dry
    density for the lot, a separate reference density shall be determined for
    each test site.
</p>
<p>
    If a compaction scale is not specified in Table 290.171, the Scale C
    compaction procedure shall be adopted.
</p>
<p>
    The calculation of density ratio determined in accordance with RC 316.00
    shall be based on Standard compactive effort of the laboratory prepared
    sample for reference density containing the design rate of the stabilising
    binder.
</p>
<p>
    The work shall be assessed for compliance with Scale A, B or C requirements
    for testing and acceptance of compaction as specified in clauses 290.14(b)
    or (c).
</p>
<p>
    For work to be tested for compliance with Scale A or Scale B requirements,
    the number of randomly selected test sites per lot shall be six, unless the
    option of clause 173.04(d) for testing of small areas is applicable.
</p>
<p>
    Sampling for CBR testing shall be undertaken after field compaction,
    including samples for grading and PI.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Lime Stabilised Material
</p>
<p>
    For stabilised earthworks incorporating lime only, density testing shall be
    undertaken within 24 hours after completion of compaction. Unless otherwise
    directed by the Superintendent, remoulding of compacted specimens for
    determination of the laboratory reference density at each test site shall
    be completed within 24 hours after extraction of samples from the
    stabilised material.
</p>
<p>
    The calculation of the characteristic or mean density ratio shall be based
    on Standard compactive effort. Lime stabilised material shall be compacted
    to comply with the requirements of Table 290.141.
</p>
<p>
    For lime stabilised material, if the characteristic density ratio is not
    achieved, the material shall be immediately reworked and/or re compacted as
    specified in clause 290.10 to meet specification requirements.

    (ii) Determination of the Density Ratio
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk7179733">
        The determination of the reference density for the test site shall be
        within 24 hours of the time of addition of the cementitious binder and
        shall be in accordance with RC 316.00, utilising the appropriate
        Density Decay Correction Factors from (A) or (B) below.
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    The following procedure shall be used to determine the Density Ratio for
    each test site:
</p>
<p>
    1. measure field density on completion of compaction
</p>
<p>
    2. extract samples and transport to an offsite laboratory
</p>
<p>
    3. determine the reference density for the laboratory compacted samples as
    soon as practicable but not exceeding 24 hours after addition of
    cementitious binder
</p>
<p>
    4. calculate a density ratio at time t (DRt) based on the results of items
    1 and 3
</p>
<p>
    5. determine the test site Density Ratio (DR) from: -
</p>
<p>
    <strong>DR = DR</strong>
    <strong><sub>t</sub></strong>
    <strong> x DDCF</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Where:
</p>
<p>
    DRt = Density Ratio calculated using the reference density determined at
    time (t)
</p>
<p>
    DDCF = Density Decay Correction Factor determined from (A) or (B) below, as
    appropriate
</p>
<p>
    (A) For individual jobs using cementitious stabilisation of more than
    20,000 m<sup>2</sup> where Type A material properties are required, or
    50,000 m<sup>2</sup> where Type B material properties are required, the
    Contractor shall determine and apply a job specific DDCF determined in
    accordance with the relevant Test Method specified in RC 500.16.
</p>
<p>
    (B) For individual jobs using cementitious stabilisation of less area than
    (A) above, the Contractor shall select and apply the appropriate Density
    Decay Correction Factor from Table 290.143 corresponding to time (t), the
    binder type and the time of year that construction is being undertaken.

    (d) Material CBR Requirements
</p>
<p>
    The initial lot of the stabilised material shall be tested to determine the
    Assigned CBR in accordance with RC 500.20. Unless otherwise approved by the
    Superintendent, sampling for CBR testing shall be undertaken after field
    compaction of the initial lot.
</p>
<p>
    290.15 MINIMUM TESTING FREQUENCY
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out testing at a frequency which is sufficient
    to ensure that the materials and work supplied under the Contract complies
    with the specified requirements but which is not less than that shown in
    Table 290.151.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Frequency of Density Testing for Assessment of Compaction
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall initially test every lot for acceptance of compaction
    in accordance with the requirements of the Specification. Density testing
    of every lot shall continue until three consecutive lots of like material
    or work have achieved the specified standard when tested for the first
    time. The Contractor shall reduce the frequency of density testing to the
    minimum testing requirements specified after satisfying the above
    requirement.
</p>
<p>
    If the Contractor has satisfied the above requirement and is density
    testing lots at the minimum test frequency and any lot fails to achieve the
    specified standard, the Contractor shall test all subsequent lots until
    three consecutive lots of like material or work have achieved the specified
    standard, at which time the frequency of density testing shall again be
    reduced to the minimum frequency.
</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of this sub&#8209;clause, acceptance of compaction for
    small areas as defined in Section 173 will not be regarded as satisfying
    the initial testing requirements stated above.
