    708.06 MATERIAL HANDLING AND STORAGE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that loading, transport, unloading, stacking
    and handling operations before and after fabrication, are carried out in
    such a way that items are protected from distortion and that galvanised
    surfaces are protected from damage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All materials and components shall be stored in such a manner that damage
    and corrosion are prevented. Generally, storage at least 200 mm above the
    ground on platforms, slabs, or other supports under cover will be
    satisfactory. Rusted or bent or damaged steel shall be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall store components in such a manner that the freshly
    galvanised surfaces are protected from the attack of 'white rust', which
    can occur on freshly galvanised articles that are transported or stored
    under damp or badly ventilated conditions (including contact stacking).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If stacks are located behind a serviceable road safety barrier system, the
    clear space between the road safety barrier system and the stack must allow
    for the dynamic deflection of the system and be at sufficient distance from
    the ends of the system to allow the proper functioning of the end
    treatments.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction of guard fence includes supply, delivery, handling and
    assembly of component and devices, setting out, and supply and installation
    of delineation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall plan and execute the work in a manner that prevents
    damage to underground and above ground facilities such as utilities,
    services, structures, pavements, vegetation, etc.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall construct the guard fence to form a smooth line
    vertically and horizontally, when viewed along the line of the
    installation, free of humps, sags, or other irregularities, within
    tolerances.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any component of a guard fence must not be welded or flame cut in the field
    under any circumstances. Welding and flame cutting in a workshop may be
    undertaken only where shown on the Drawings or in accordance with the
    manufacturer's recommendations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Damage
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the galvanising on guard fence components or associated fittings has
    been damaged, the coating shall be repaired by regalvanising or by painting
    with a minimum of two coats of a zinc&#8209;rich inorganic paint in
    accordance with AS/NZS 3750.9 and one coat of aluminium paint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Sequence of work
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the guard fence is being constructed on a road open to traffic, the
    Contractor shall carry out the work so end treatments and transitions can
    be commissioned at the earliest practicable time, desirably on the day of
    installation. Where this cannot be achieved on the day, temporary end
    treatments to the satisfaction of the Superintendent shall be provided
    until the permanent treatment is complete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Removal of redundant safety barrier systems
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Removal of an existing installed safety barrier system includes:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) dismantling or demolition of safety barriers, transitions and end
    treatments;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) extracting all posts, anchors and other in-ground components and
    materials;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) removing all components and waste materials from the site;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) cleaning, backfilling and mechanically compacting all excavations and
    holes formed by the extraction of posts, anchors and other in-ground
    components and materials; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (v) stacking or disposing of components and waste materials.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Following the removal of all redundant posts, anchors and other in-ground
    components by extraction or excavation, the holes shall be cleaned and
    backfilled. Backfilling and compaction of holes shall proceed in 150 mm
    layers using similar materials to existing surrounding layers. The backfill
    shall be compacted to not less than the density of the surrounding layers.

    (a) Posts
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Posts shall be installed to the depth, line and spacing shown on the
    drawings, and to the tolerances in Clause 708.07(d).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Posts shall be orientated to the direction of traffic as shown on the
    drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Posts shall be installed by driving, provided there is no distortion or
    damage which may reduce their effectiveness. The installation must not
    cause any damage to the pavement beyond 100 mm from any part of any post,
    including any soil plate attached to the post.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If site conditions dictate that the posts cannot be driven, then the posts
    shall be installed in holes. The bottom of the holes shall be adequately
    compacted to achieve the same density as the surrounding soil. The posts
    shall be supported to true line and level while the holes are backfilled
    with clean, well-graded, non-cementitious subbase or base course granular
    material and compacted to achieve the same density as the surrounding soil.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All post holes in rock shall have a 75 mm minimum clearance from the back
    of the post to the face of the hole.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Except for anchorage posts, post holes in rock shall be backfilled with
    granular material. Other post holes shall be backfilled with selected
    earth, free of rock. The backfilling shall be firmly compacted in layers
    not exceeding 100 mm compacted thickness. Where posts are located in areas
    to be paved with concrete or premixed bituminous material, the backfilling
    of the post holes shall be finished 50 mm below the underside of such
    paving and the remaining depth of the holes shall be filled and compacted
    with material similar to the surrounding material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The foundation of any post shall be deemed complying when the displacement
    at ground level does not exceed 3 mm when a 1 kN force is applied 200 mm
    below the top of the post in any direction. For any posts failing the test,
    the Contractor shall take remedial measures and retest the rectified post
    plus one other similar post within 5 m.

        HP Prior to the installation of any w-beam barrier system where non
        standard post lengths are required or other special measures (e.g.
        shallow concrete foundations) are proposed to be used, the Contractor
        shall provide details of the measures proposed and evidence that the
        effectiveness of the barrier system will be maintained, for
        consideration by the Superintendent. Where shallow foundations that
        require a concrete ground beam are proposed to be constructed, the
        design shall be proof engineered by a VicRoads pre-qualified
        consultant.

    (c) End treatments
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During installation of wire ropes in the end treatments of w-beam, the
    Contractor shall ensure that no twisting of the rope occurs. When rope
    assemblies are used, the nuts at each end of the rope shall be tightened to
    a minimum torque of 50 Nm on the assemblies or as per the manufacturer's
    requirements.
    <p>
    </p>
