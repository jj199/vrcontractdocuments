    This specification provides details regarding the testing, integration and
    the maintenance handover that the Contractor shall complete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The testing, integration and handover specification covers the following
    ITS devices:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Freeway Ramp Signal Sites, including Freeway-to-Freeway Ramp Signals
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Lane Use Management System
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Variable Message Signs
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Travel Time Signs
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Freeway Data Stations
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        CCTV Cameras.
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Furthermore, certain ITS devices are considered a Major Traffic Control
    Device (MTCD), therefore these devices are subjected to a hold point during
    the POP testing stage. This Hold Point is required to be released before
    the Contractor may continue.

    736.05 MAJOR TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Traffic control device (TCD) is a term that covers the traffic signs, road
    markings and traffic signals that are integral to the safe and efficient
    use of Victoria's roads. These devices establish and support the rules by
    which roads are used; conveying information to road users, making the
    roadway safe, and provide protection for vulnerable road users.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Major traffic control devices (MTCD) place a significant and legally
    enforceable condition on what road users may do and/or can have a
    significant impact on the use of a road. For further information, refer to
    ANS&amp;G 2.2 Ed 1 - First edition - replaces VicRoads Traffic Engineering
    Manual Volume 1 - Chapter 2 - Authorisation of Traffic Control Devices.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
The following ITS devices are considered MTCD, and therefore<strong>THE</strong>    <strong>HOLD POINT AT POP STAGE NEEDS TO BE RELEASED.</strong>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General Testing Requirements
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As a minimum, the Contractor shall perform the testing specified in clause
    736.07 for all devices. Tests that are not successfully completed shall
    require system modification and then retesting until all items are
    successfully tested. Electronic and hard copies of all testing and
    commissioning documents on freeway management devices installed by the
    Contractor shall be provided/delivered to the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of FAT is to confirm that all functions that are required by
    VicRoads are delivered by the device or system in a standalone sample. FAT
    is completed in the factory before the equipment is shipped. FAT must be
    completed successfully before any material is delivered to the site and
    installed. FAT shall fully cover all requirements including those in all
    linked specifications.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This is completed for appropriate ITS devices prior to installation in the
    field. The purpose of the Pre-POP is to ensure that the equipment works
    locally prior to installation and that it continues to deliver the
    functionality that VicRoads requires. Pre-POP provides the opportunity for
    early identification of issues and to test a wide range of scenarios that
    may be difficult or time consuming to test in the field.

    (d) Off-Site Subsystem Integration Testing (Pre-SIT)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This is performed once the Pre-POP is complete for appropriate ITS devices
    prior to installation in the field. The SIT is an end-to-end test from the
    central communications node out to the devices to confirm that the devices
    can be controlled from the central communications node. As the
    communication network used is not in its final state when off-site, this
    aspect is required to be verified in SIT. Pre-SIT provides the opportunity
    for early identification of issues and to test a wide range of scenarios
    that may be difficult or time consuming to test in the field.

    (b) Change Requests
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All changes planned by the Contractor that will or may impact on VicRoads
    ITS Services (including changes requested by VicRoads) must have a change
    request in the VicRoads Change Management System.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Change requests submitted by the Contractor will not be dealt with if there
    are insufficient details about the change to allow full and proper
    assessment. Where applicable, the change request must address the following
    aspects:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) priority / change type
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) business purpose

</p>
<p>
    (vii) expected implementation date and time and details of any
    system/component outages; including outage start date/time and end
    date/time
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (viii) implementation plan including responsibilities, notifications and
    escalations (including contacts and name and contact number of Contractor's
    personnel performing change), environment(s), hardware requirements and
    lead delivery times
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ix) technical and business risk analysis and mitigation
    <p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Types of Change Requests
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Change requests must be classified with one of the following Change Class
    types. The Class needs to reflect the risk and timing of implementing the
    change and will determine the level of control, scrutiny, detail and
    planning that will be required:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Normal:</strong>
    Meets lead times for review and approval. Does not require prioritised
    treatment. This is the default class for most changes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Standard:</strong>
    Pre-approved and pre-authorised change created from a template. No outage
    or service degradation, no impact to business, repeatable with no
    deviation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Emergency:</strong>
    Required immediately to resolve a high priority (Priority 1 or 2) Incident
    or Problem. Emergency changes and their impact should always be
    communicated to Change Management and the Service Desk.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To avoid any imminent or potential failure or to fix or mitigate an
    existing critical issue, the Contractor may conduct an emergency change to
    fix the identified issue or problem. The details pertaining to the
    emergency change conducted must be later added to the VicRoads' Change
    Management system by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All the artefacts such as implementation plan, roll back strategy, test
    plan and description of the issue (in case of an emergency change) must be
    submitted in the Emergency Change Request.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Expedited: </strong>
    Requested by the VicRoads business to meet an urgent business need, where
    normal lead times cannot be met. Urgent justification must be provided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor will submit change requests as listed below prior to the
    earliest expected implementation date unless prior agreement is obtained
    from the Superintendent or unless the change is an emergency change as
    stipulated below in emergency changes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Lead Times
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Change Requests must be raised within the following lead times to allow
    adequate time for review, approval and communication:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Low priority change requests: </strong>
        raised five days prior to implementation
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Medium priority change requests: </strong>
        raised ten days prior to implementation
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>High or Critical change requests: </strong>
        raised twenty business days prior to implementation * outage refers to
        disruptions to both end user performance as well as to key elements.
        <p>

    The Contractor shall then update the plan based on feedback. The Contractor
    shall also periodically update Change Management Plans as the Contract
    progresses and circumstances change. The Contractor shall document the
    planned Change Management activities against the actual work achieved. All
    cases where work is delayed or modified due to unanticipated events, or due
    to lack of progress by the Contractor or by other contractors shall be
    noted. Situations where the ITS activities adversely impact on the TMC
    operations shall also be recorded.

    (e) Impact of Change Assessment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    VicRoads will co-ordinate the assessment and approval of change requests,
    including the involvement of VicRoads business units, VicRoads business
    partners, VicRoads service desk and other service providers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor will provide further input to the assessment of any change
    request as reasonably requested by the Superintendent and in any time frame
    reasonable requested. This includes any change not initiated by the
    Contractor but which may impact on the services.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) Scheduling and Planning Change Requests
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor will schedule and submit the Change Requests in VicRoads
    Change Management systems.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Change Planning
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All Changes with planned service disruptions shall be discussed and agreed
    between the Contractor and VicRoads. If, at any point in the change
    implementation stage or planned service disruption, VicRoads considers that
    there is a risk to the VicRoads TMC operations not being available as
    required, the Superintendent will advise the Contractor and the Contractor
    shall not proceed with the change implementation or planned service
    disruption.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may request the Contractor to reschedule approved
    changes to meet the requirements of VicRoads. The Contractor will inform
    the Superintendent of any potential risks resulting from the change or
    rescheduling of other approved changes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Implementing Change Requests
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor will implement approved changes as documented within the
    VicRoads Change Management System and update the Configuration Management
    Database (if applicable) when a change is successfully implemented.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Please refer to the attached ITS Change Management Scheduling guidelines.

<p>
    (iii) ITS Changes - Scheduling Guidelines
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All ITS changes on the production environment (unless it is an emergency
    change) should be scheduled during the off-peak times. Off peak times are
    as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Weekdays: Monday - Thursday
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Morning off peak-time - 09:00 AM - 03:00 PM
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Friday after hours - changes not allowed if an outage will be caused
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Weekends
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Changes request planned for weekends will be reviewed and approved case by
    case depending on the impact to business, stakeholder approval, any major
    events scheduled around the same time, availability of support staff to
    carry out any pre and post implementation testing, etc.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the change will result in an outage to an ITS application or ITS devices
    following process should be followed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The approval needs to be sought from relevant stakeholders including TMC.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On the day of implementing the change, the change implementer/owner should
    contact TMC and seek approval for go-ahead prior to commencement of change.
    Scheduled start time may vary if TMC require continued access to the
    impacted application/device for incident response/to assist emergency
    services.

    changes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for and incorporate into the Change
    Management Plan all liaisons with other contractors that may have an impact
    on the timing of when the integration may occur or the nature of the
    integration. The Contractor shall outline any risks (known and potential)
    and all impacts (known and potential) to proceed with the successful change
    implementation as defined in the plan. The Contractor shall clearly outline
    the start and end time of all work and operational impacts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for liaising with VicRoads Traffic
    Management Centre (TMC) to determine if there are any planned closures,
    special events or any activity occurring during the off-peak periods that
    will require use of any of the system functions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any unsuccessful change shall be backed out and tested according to the
    pre-planned Back-out Plan.

</p>
<p>
    (g) Roll Back Strategy
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each Change Management Plan shall include a rollback strategy as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) for the new field equipment, backbone communications and power supply,
    a rollback strategy shall be provided following the first delivery phase
    (prior to that date, the VicRoads TMC will not be using any of the new
    field devices, communications backbone or power supply so no rollback
    strategy is required)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) for existing communications to the CCTV that are to be integrated into
    the Streams System, existing leased communications shall be kept live for a
    period of time (minimum one month) after the main communications system has
    passed sub-system integration testing (SIT) as a backup.

</p>
<p>
    (h) Post Change Review and Verification
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor will review and test (provision of a certificate of
    completion of test or notification of completion indicates that the
    Contractor certifies the testing) each change as soon as practicable after
    successful implementation and include any issues in the change request,
    including any unsuccessful attempts and the reasons for failure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    The Contractor will notify VicRoads once the change has been implemented
    for VicRoads to test and verify the success of the change. If any errors
    are detected with a change, VicRoads will immediately notify the Contractor
    of the error(s). The Contractor shall, in cooperation with VicRoads,
    provide a resolution which will be either to back-out the change or reapply
    the change (with or without alteration).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    VicRoads may also conduct a post-change review of any change. The
    Contractor will participate in such post change reviews as reasonably
    requested by VicRoads. This includes changes that are not initiated by the
    Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should a change fail or not go to plan, the Contractor shall complete a
    Post Implementation Review document within 5 business days and attach it to
    the change request.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

    been fulfilled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Support staff and Vendors will be discouraged from undertaking changes
    approximately between third week of December to second week of January,
    with the exception of:

    with VicRoads in the Change and Integration Management Plan.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) The Contractor must ensure that a change should not result in a major
    incident (P1 or P2). In the event a major incident occurs the Contractor
    must be accountable and must take immediate action to resolve it. The
    Contractor must ensure the number of failed changes does not exceed 10% of
    all changes implemented by the Contractor per month irrespective of the
    change classification.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    The following criteria can be used to define a failed change:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) change that has a direct impact on VicRoads service being impacted
    within 7 days of change implementation; or
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) change that has not met the original goal or its expected result.
