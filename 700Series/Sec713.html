    713.07 PERIMETER AND TOE WALLS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Perimeter and toe walls shall be constructed where shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For Type 1 Beaching, toe walls 600 mm wide by 600 mm deep shall be
    constructed. They shall be lined with geotextile fabric and filled with
    hand packed rock, the larger voids between rocks being filled with smaller
    stones. Where Type 1 beaching is used in streams, similar walls 600 mm wide
    by 600 mm deep shall also be constructed across the upstream end of the
    beaching.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For Types 2, 3 and 4 Beaching, concrete perimeter walls shall be
    constructed around exposed edges of the beaching. Concrete used for this
    purpose shall be N20 strength grade complying with Section 703.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Toe walls shall be 300 mm wide by 400 mm deep at the front face and
    reinforced with L8TM trench mesh top and bottom. The upper surface of the
    toe wall shall slope upwards at either the slope of the rock beaching or
    the adjacent verge as shown on the drawings. Side walls and other perimeter
    walls shall be 150 mm wide by 250 mm deep. The top of the walls shall be
    continuous with the beaching.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For Type 5 Beaching, perimeter and toe edge rocks will depend on site and
    hydraulic conditions and shall be constructed in conjunction with Melbourne
    Water. Perimeter and toe edge rocks shall be trenched into in situ ground
    before bedding placement. Such rocks shall have a minimum embedment depth
    of 600 mm and shall finish flush with the surrounding ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Perimeter and toe edge rocks may require a granular bedding and an
    underlying geotextile filter layer, if warranted by the site and hydraulic
    conditions. All rocks shall be carefully placed into position, rather than
    dumped directly, so as to avoid segregation of the rock sizes.

    713.08 DRAINAGE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Where specified or shown on the drawings, a 100 mm diameter PVC pipe
    shall be laid down the batter in a trench beneath the bedding to discharge
    immediately above the top of the toe wall. The pipe shall be securely
    bedded within the backfilled compacted crushed rock or natural gravel
    trench.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Weepholes consisting of 75 mm diameter PVC pipes shall be placed
    through the beaching at 2 m centres immediately above the top of the
    concrete toe wall and cut off flush with the face of beaching. Weepholes
    and other drainage lines shall not directly discharge onto areas of public
    access or shared user pathways.

    713.09 CLEANING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On completion of the work, the beaching shall be cleaned to remove all
    foreign materials and discolouration from the beaching surface. Any joint
    mortar adhering to the surrounding rock surfaces shall be removed.
    <p>
