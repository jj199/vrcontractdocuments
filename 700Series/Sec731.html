    as detailed in (i) and (ii) below.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Joints in the trunk cable for any other purpose (e.g. to extend a cable

</ul>
<p>
    All connectors shall be further protected from water ingress by use of a
    water-displacing gel filled cap.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The enclosure shall be designed to be held in place on the side of the pit,
    just under the pit lid, using a suitable mounting bracket. See Standard

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Suitable sized, insulation piercing, low voltage, waterproof connector.
    Such connectors shall be the type that use torque controlled, shearing type
    bolts. This type of connection shall also use an 'in&#8209;line'
    submersible 8 amp fuse to enable complete isolation of pole for maintenance
    purposes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Alternative forms of jointing may be allowed only with the approval of
        the Superintendent and the agreement of the ITS Solutions Development
        Team.

<p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Pole Cabling
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each pole shall be cabled from the cable joint in the adjacent pit to the
    luminaire located at the limit of the bracket arm using one of the
    following methods:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) 2 m<sup>2 </sup>core, power industry cable with separate earth cable
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) 2.5 mm<sup>2</sup>, 2 core and earth, TPS (between luminaires on a
    double outreach only)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Note: The use of 2.5<sup>2</sup> TPS within the pole is no longer an
    approved wiring method.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In an impact absorbing pole the cable shall be supplied through the
    flexible conduit fitted inside the pole from the cable termination access
    door to the pole spigot, as shown in Standard Drawing TC&#8209;1064. If a
    double bracket arm is used, 1.5 m of cable shall be looped between the
    luminaires.

    731.12 LABELLING OF INSTALLED ASSETS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor is to affix labels to all road lighting assets installed
    under this contract in accordance with this clause.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall supply all blank self-adhesive base labels and
    self-adhesive numbers in accordance with this section. The Contractor shall
    attach all numbers to the base label, in accordance with the correct
    matching asset records as supplied to the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall thoroughly clean the area on the pole to be covered by
    the label prior to attaching the label and if a liquid cleaning solution is
    used, ensure that the pole is completely dry before application. Any labels
    that delaminate due to insufficient surface preparation shall be rectified
    by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Distribution Cabinet Labelling
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A cabinet identification label conforming to VicRoads Standard Drawing
    TC&#8209;2100 shall be affixed to the distribution cabinet. The
    Superintendent will advise of the site number. The Contractor shall
    maintain the cabinet label(s) to be clean, free of graffiti and clearly
    legible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The label shall be located such that is can be viewed from the roadway.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Pole Labelling
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each lighting pole shall have a label affixed to it in accordance with
    drawing number TC&#8209;2106. A VicRoads full asset number consists of a
    5&#8209;digit site asset number followed by a 3&#8209;digit pole number.
    The string of 8 numbers is considered the full pole number. The pole
    location identifier provides for additional information to be coded. See
    standard drawings TC&#8209;1076 and TC&#8209;1077.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each label installed shall have the correct number overlays stuck on -
    matching the pole identification as per plans and inventory information
    provided by the Superintendent. There shall be no blank squares/boxes on a
    pole identification label and each square shall contain a number from 0 to
    9.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It is a requirement to remove all other existing non-approved asset
    numbers/labels written, painted or marked on those poles covered by this
    contract by a method approved by the Superintendent, so that the new pole
    identification label is the only visible asset identifier on the pole.
    However, labels indicating the date of latest re-tension for pole
    specifications etc. are to be left untouched. All rubbish generated from
    these works is to be properly disposed of by the Contractor off site.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The pole label shall directly face oncoming traffic at approximately a 45
    degree angle between 2.5 m to 3 m above the surrounding ground level. For
    any lighting pole with a single outreach, one label shall be installed. For
    any lighting pole with a double outreach and/or lighting up multiple
    passageways, two labels shall be installed so that they are facing oncoming
    traffic, allowing it to be readable from either direction. See standard
    drawing TC&#8209;1078.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent will advise of the pole numbering to be adopted for each
    pole.
