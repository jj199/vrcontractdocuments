        by the Superintendent who shall confirm the positions before the
        erection of posts commences.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Post details shall be as shown on the Sign and Post Schedule and in

        If the Contractor proposes the use of an alternative post and sign
        installation, full details of the proposals shall be supplied to the
        Superintendent for review not later than four weeks before

    The Contractor shall conform to the requirements of Clause 714.04 and the
    Sign and Post Schedule.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel posts shall be manufactured from steel complying with AS/NZS 1163, AS
    1397 or AS 1450, and having a minimum yield strength of 250 MPa.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    Signs to be mounted on two or more posts shall have posts positioned such
    that the sign face is rotated away from the approaching traffic to avoid
    direct reflection. Posts shall be positioned such that the sign is rotated
    away from the cross section by an amount equal to one tenth of the width of
    the sign (approximately 5&#186;).
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    Posts specified as frangible hardwood shall be set at a level such that the
    centre of the lower hole of each post is 75 mm above the finished surface
    at the base of the post.

<p>
    &#8226; Pre-galvanised prior to forming in accordance with Z275 coating
class to AS 1397 (total minimum coating mass on both surfaces of 275 g/m    <sup>2</sup>). The finished tube must be equivalent to AS/NZS 4792
    ZB135/135. The weld seam made during forming of pre-galvanised steel post
    sections shall be repaired in accordance with AS/NZS 4792, Section 3, by
    applying a coating using a metal spraying system employing a suitable zinc
    or zinc-alloy wire/powder.
    <p>

    (b) For braced signs, the sign shall be attached to the post at every
    intersection point between the sign bracing member and the post.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Where a sign assembly consists of two or more signs, the signs shall be
    mounted in accordance with the sign assembly drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Signs shall be positioned in accordance with the following tolerances:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) &#177; 40 mm of the height specified in the Sign and Post Schedule
    measured from the bottom of the sign or sign assembly to the lip of the
    kerb or edge of shoulder nearest the sign;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) &#177; 100 mm of the pegged sign location or specified location.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) When a sign is to be mounted on frangible posts on a cut batter having
    a slope steeper than or equal to 2:1, the mounting height at the shorter
    post may be reduced providing that:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) the uphill corner of the sign is a minimum of 800 mm above the ground;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the sign at the longer post is 2200 mm minimum above the ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) If required on the drawings sign faces shall be mounted on existing
    roadside poles, lighting columns, traffic signal pedestals. Where a sign is
    to be mounted with stainless steel straps, the brackets shall be attached
    to the pole using stainless steel straps of 12 mm minimum width and a
    minimum tensile strength 6.5 kN.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Small signs with an area of not exceeding 0.3 m&#178; shall be attached to
    steel or concrete electricity distribution poles, tramway poles, lighting
    columns and signal pedestals or mast arms by banding or other proprietary
    fittings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Signs exceeding 0.3 m&#178; in area may be attached to existing poles
    (other than electricity distribution poles) provided that the pole has
    sufficient strength to support the additional loading due to the sign and
    that special joint-use supports are used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        If the Contractor proposes to mount a sign on an existing pole, the
        strength of the pole and any other effects of mounting the sign in this
        way such as fatigue and durability shall be checked by an experienced
        structural engineer. Evidence of the structural checking shall be
        submitted to the Superintendent for review. The Contractor shall obtain
        permission shall for use of structures which are not VicRoads property.

<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    The maximum signboard areas which may be attached to joint-use structures
    are:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; standard 114 mm OD signal pedestal - 1.0 m&#178;
    <p>

<p>
    &#8226; joint use traffic signal/lighting column or traffic signal mast arm
    - 1.6 m&#178; less the area of any traffic signal target boards facing in
    the same direction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Minimum lateral and vertical clearances adjacent and under the sign shall
    be maintained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (g) Where the drawings indicate that a sign is to face oncoming traffic, it
    shall be mounted on posts which have been rotated in accordance with the
    requirements of Clause 714.06(a), with the exception of signs mounted on
    structures over traffic lanes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (h) Where signs are to be removed or relocated, as specified in the
    schedule, the Contractor shall dismantle and transport the signs, posts and
    fittings to the specified new location or as directed by the
    Superintendent. Post holes shall be backfilled and compacted to the
    finished surface. Relocated signs shall be erected in their new position as
    specified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) After erection of each sign all stiffening bars are to be removed.
    <p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (j) Single post mounting for large signs shall be provided if required on
    the drawings and the schedule. Single post mountings shall be designed in
    accordance with the VicRoads Traffic Engineering Manual Volume 2. Such
    supports are not to be made as breakaway supports.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (k) Installation of proprietary signs approved by VicRoads shall be in
    accordance with the supplier's recommendations as modified by VicRoads
    conditions of approval.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where indicated in the schedule, the Contractor shall mask the nominated
    sign(s) by placing a porous cloth or similar covering that conceals the
    sign text under both wet and dry conditions and does not void the sign
    material warranty. The masking material shall be held in position by wire
    mesh over the sign.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Adhesive material shall only be applied to the masking material and not be
    applied to either the front or rear face of the signboard.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Signs marked 'm' in the Sign and Post Schedule shall be masked.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The size of the masking material and its method of attachment shall be such
    that the sign is:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; effectively and securely covered;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; wholly or partly covered, as required;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; covered at all times and under all conditions.
