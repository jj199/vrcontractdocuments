    shall follow methods which provide best level of resiliency, for example,
    using fibre cores from different tubes within the trunk. Where a backbone
    fibre optic trunk is used to connect more than one pair of Backbone nodes,

    at each end) are necessary to connect a single Freeway Management device to
    the access switch. The fibre-optic cable between the two device media
    converters shall be a separate 12 core cable single mode fibre and must not
    use the backbone trunk cable. Media converters shall only be permitted for
    remotely located CCTV camera or FDS or as otherwise approved by the

    (k) Redundancy and Fail-over
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    The ITS Communication Network shall support a redundancy mechanism to
    provide protection as described below:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (i) For multiple 10 Gbps backbone links between two backbone routers:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    If one 10 Gbps backbone link is down, the data traffic shall be
    automatically switched onto another 10 Gbps link. The switch over time
    shall be no more than 50 milliseconds.

</p>
<p align="left">
    (ii) For backbone links on one backbone router:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    If all backbone links toward a neighbour backbone router are down all data
    traffic in this direction shall be switched over automatically to the
    backbone link towards the neighbour backbone router in the other direction.
    Switch over time shall be no more than 50 milliseconds.
    <p>
    </p>

<p align="left">
    (iii) For each access ring between two backbone routers:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    The two backbone routers shall provide a redundancy gateway function and
    corresponding routing function for the whole access ring.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    For data traffic between each access ring and backbone routers traffic
    balance shall be applied. Access switches on each ring shall be divided
    into two sequenced, as far as possible of equal quantity, groups. The data
    traffic from the one group will use backbone router 'A' as the primary
    gateway and backbone router 'B' as the secondary gateway. The second group
    will use backbone router 'B' as the primary gateway and backbone router 'A'
    as the secondary gateway.
    <p>

    backbone router 'B', backbone router 'A' will take over the gateway and
    routing function.

    other suitable technology) function to support the access ring for
    maintaining the access ring topology.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    The backbone network shall provide primary and backup MPLS Pseudowire (or
    other suitable technology) for access rings; the primary and backup MPLS
    Pseudowire shall have full diversity. If the primary MPLS Pseudowire is
    'failed', the time for failover to back up MPLS Pseudowire shall be no more
    than 50 milliseconds.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (v) The access rings shall use Resilient Ethernet Protocol (REP) or other
    protocol with similar functionality as approved by the Superintendent to
    maintain the topology and the redundancy. The layer 2 MPLS tunnel shall be
    provided on backbone routers to support access rings to maintain the
    topology and recovery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (vi) The time for failover of each access ring shall be no more than 10
    seconds. This means, during an access ring failover, the down time of
    connectivity between Freeway Management Devices and backend server (ITS
    server and NMS server at TMC or DRC) shall be no more than 10 seconds.

    The following topology principles shall be used for the connection of the
    network.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (i) Access switches between two backbone routers shall be connected as
    several chains with each end of a chain connected to a backbone router. For
    each chain, the two ends of the chain connect with each other through the
    tunnel of backbone routers so that each chain becomes an access ring.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (ii) In all roadside cabinets containing a field processor or multiple
    devices, an access switch shall be installed. For a single device such as a
    CCTV or FDS a pole mounted cabinet can be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (iii) All interconnections between access switches shall use fibre
    interfaces. All interconnection between access switches and backbone router
    shall use fibre interfaces. All interconnection between backbone routers
    shall use fibre interfaces.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="left">
    (iv) All devices within the same cabinet as an access switch shall be
    connected to the access switch by CAT6 cable. When media converters are
    used, CAT6 cable between the media converter and the access switch shall be
    used.
    <p>

    (v) There shall be no more than ten (10) access switches within each access
    ring. Total number of access rings shall be determined at detailed design
