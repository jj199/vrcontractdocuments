<p>
    All power cabling shall be fully compliant with AS/NZS 3000 and the
    specific requirements for mains power cabling and architecture detailed in
    individual contract documents.
</p>
<p>
    Cables and cable capacity shall be designed to be suitable for the intended
    purpose, with appropriate capacity for the intended load. Cable shall be
    procured so that it will not be necessary to have a cable joints between
    termination points. The Contractor shall submit a power cable schedule to
    the Superintendent for review prior to procurement of any cable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Locations where cable joints are required due to extended distance
        shall be approved by the Superintendent. The Contractor shall submit a
        detailed proposal for all such locations, including plans with the
        joins clearly marked. All such joints shall be above ground, clearly
        marked and in a VicRoads approved enclosure, with the exception of road
        lighting.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Under no circumstances, shall a cable joint be placed within a conduit.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For all cables the Contractor shall provide an additional length of cable
    of not less than 2 metres at each cable end. The additional cable shall be
    coiled within the pit adjacent to each site.
</p>
<p>
    For all electrical pits containing cabling within the Works, an additional
    length of cable of not less than 2 metres shall be coiled within each third
    pit.

    friction between the cable and the conduit and other cables. An approved
    lubricant shall be used to reduce friction.
</p>
<p>
    Care shall be taken to avoid damage to the sheath and/or insulation at
    changes of direction, within pits, or at transitions between different
    methods of installation.

</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall prevent wet contact between electrolytically
    dissimilar metals either by using electrically insulating barriers or by
    excluding moisture from the contact zone. Where electrical isolation is to
    be avoided such as with equipotential bonding for earthing or lightning
    protection, the Contractor shall select metals which avoid large
    electrochemical potential differences, use fusion jointing such as brazing
    or welding or exclude water using proprietary systems. The Contractor shall
    submit its proposed method to be used to the Superintendent for review.
