    709.03 PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All guide posts including delineators installed in a section of road shall
    be uniform material and design.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General Requirements
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guide posts shall be between 90 mm and 100 mm across the face visible by
    traffic. The tops of guideposts shall be flat, the bottom ends made to suit
    the method of installation as recommended by the manufacturer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guide posts shall be straight, smooth, structurally sound and of a shape
    that allows delineators to be permanently and securely attached. The above
    ground section of each guide post shall be free of sharp edges and burrs
    and discoloration or other defects that may affect its appearance and/or
    serviceability.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The supplier shall state the type of material used in manufacture of the
    guide posts as well as recommended methods of installation, anchoring
    depth, cleaning, removal, and disposal. Test certification shall be
    submitted to the Superintendent, addressing post strength, flexibility,
    impact performance, durability, heat resistance, fire retardant ability,
    corrosion resistance and cold resistance. The supplier shall provide a
    performance guarantee statement clearly indicating the nature of the
    guarantee and the service life expectancy. Where a product is a VicRoads
    approved guide post product the above shall not be required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All types of guideposts shall respond in a safe manner when struck, and not
    present a further danger in their damaged condition.
    <p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Delineators
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall fix retro reflective type delineators to guide posts
    on both sides of the carriageway to expose to approaching traffic a red
    delineator on the left and a white delineator on the right.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Delineators shall be either:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) circular 80 mm diameter Type A corner cube retro reflectors conforming
    with Type 'A' delineator in AS 1906.2; or
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Class 1A retro reflective sheeting having a total minimum reflective
    output equivalent to 100 cm<sup>2</sup>, as defined in AS/NZS 1906.1. The
    nominal dimension of retro reflective material shall be 50 mm x 200 mm.
    Delineators made from retro reflective sheeting shall be installed such
    that the sheeting manufacturer's preferred orientation for optimum
    performance is followed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Delineators shall be placed centrally between the edges of posts, with the
    top of the delineator 50 mm below the top edge. Delineators shall be
    attached to posts following completion of final protective coatings by a
    vandal&#8209;proof and weatherproof means so they can be replaced if
    necessary without damaging the post.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Markings
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To enable traceability of the manufacturer, each post shall be legibly and
    indelibly marked with the manufacturer's name, date of manufacture and
    warranty period with lettering no greater than 10 mm high. The markings
    shall be placed at the bottom of the guide post just above recommended
    ground level installation depth. Guide posts shall be clearly marked to
    show the recommended ground level installation depth. Markings shall be
    installed on one side of the guide post only, and remain visible for the
    full life expectancy of the guide post.

    709.04 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The finished surface of guide posts shall be uniform and free from
    discontinuities, areas of discoloration, blisters, runs and other surface
    defects which affect appearance and serviceability. Guide post surfaces
    shall be durable gloss or semi-gloss opaque white capable of being
    repeatedly cleaned. All materials used shall retain 85% of the original
    colour, appearance and physical properties and be resistant to ultraviolet
    radiation for at least ten (10) years when exposed to all weather
    conditions experienced in Victoria.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guide posts shall be designed to resist bending, twisting and displacement
    due to wind. They must be effective in resistance to vertical displacement
    of <u>+</u>5 mm for the life of the guidepost, with the exception of any
    displacement associated with impact or physical force. Flexible guide posts
    shall return to within <u>+</u>5 mm of the original vertical position
    following impact or physical force application for the life of the guide
    post.

    709.05 INSTALLATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Installation of guide posts includes setting out, excavation, supply,
    placement, backfilling, erection, driving, removal and disposal of guide
    posts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guide posts shall be installed in accordance with the requirements of
    Traffic Engineering Manual Volume 2, as shown on the drawings, or as
    specified by the Superintendent. Guide posts shall be placed at a uniform
    distance from the road pavement edge with the widest face presenting to
    oncoming traffic. Posts shall be set into the ground so that the posts are
    vertical and the tops present a uniform profile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guide posts shall be installed such that the exposed length above ground is
    nominally 1000 mm and minimum anchoring depths recommended by the
    manufacturer to achieve the specified performance requirements under
    service conditions. Allowance shall be made in the height of guide posts
    above the ground for the effects of superelevation and other road geometry
    in order to keep guide posts within the range of the beam of vehicle
    headlights.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guideposts shall be installed as per the manufacturer's recommendation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where guide posts are to be set in the ground they shall be erected in
    excavated holes which are subsequently backfilled and compacted to a
    density that is not less than that of the adjacent undisturbed ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guide posts shall be installed such that they effectively resist removal by
    persons other than personnel using recommended removal tools.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where guide posts are to be installed directly onto concrete, asphalt of
    any other hard wearing surface, the Contractor shall submit to the
    Superintendent the details of the proposed installation method.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Wire Rope Safety Barrier Installations
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where new installations of Wire Rope Safety Barrier (WRSB) are proposed on
    the edge of shoulder, and will conflict with guide post installation
    locations, WRSB posts shall be converted into guide posts in accordance
    with the above product requirements. Posts shall be spaced in accordance
    with the Drawings or the requirements of Traffic Engineering Manual Volume
    2. The Contractor shall submit to the Superintendent the details of the
    proposed installation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Underground Services
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Underground service locations shall be determined prior to installation of
    posts.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Tolerances
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Maximum installation tolerances are as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) within 3 degrees of true vertical position
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) within <u>+</u>5 mm across the face visible by traffic
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) within +50 mm of the uniform profile height (nominally 1000 mm)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) within 200 mm longitudinally of the design spacing requirement and 100
    mm transversely of the plan position with reference to the design line for
    the road, or as per the requirements of Traffic Engineering Manual Volume
    2.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Removal and Disposal of Existing Guideposts
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Existing guide posts where required, are to be removed as directed by the
    Superintendant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All holes left after removal shall be backfilled and compacted to a density
    that is not less than that of the adjacent undisturbed ground, or the same
    characteristics of the shoulder material from where they were removed. All
    existing guide posts removed by the Contractor shall be disposed of
    offsite. Existing guideposts manufactured from recyclable materials shall
    be recycled.
