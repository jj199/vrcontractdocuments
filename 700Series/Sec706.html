    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers requirements for the installation or replacement of
    utility infrastructure (e.g. conduits, pipes, service pits, poles, aerial
    services/cables) within the road reserve of an arterial road or freeway, as
    shown on the drawings, or as specified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    706.02 LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The management principles and practices applying to utilities and road
    authorities for the installation, maintenance, replacement and operation of
    utility infrastructure within road reserves are set out in the Road
    Management Act 2004, Road Management (Works and Infrastructure) Regulations
    2005 and the Code of Practice for Management of Infrastructure in Road
    Reserves (Victoria Government Gazette No. S 269 Monday 6 October 2008).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All planning, design and installation or replacement of utility
    infrastructure, as shown on the drawings, or as specified, shall be carried
    out in accordance with the requirements set out in the above legislative
    framework and the additional requirements specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any consultation required with, and authorisation required from, other
    authorities under relevant utility regulations and codes shall be the
    responsibility of the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    706.03 POSITIONING, DEPTH AND HEIGHT CLEARANCE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All utility infrastructure within road reserves shall be clear of road
    carriageways and parallel or at right angles to the centreline of road
    carriageways unless otherwise agreed with the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aerial services shall have a minimum height clearance of 5.5 m above the
    finished road surface level or the natural surface. Poles for aerial
    services shall have a minimum lateral clearance of 3 m from the edge of
    carriageway in urban areas and 9 m in rural areas, except where frangible
    poles are used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise shown on the drawings or specified, utility infrastructure
    and associated conduits installed under road carriageways for freeways and
    arterial roads shall be at depths to provide the following cover over the
    top of the infrastructure (including conduit):
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) 1200 mm minimum cover to the finished road surface level; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) 750 mm minimum cover to the invert level of road carriageway open
    drains.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    706.04 BORING UNDER CARRIAGEWAYS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified or approved by the Superintendent, all utility
    infrastructure (including conduits) under road carriageways shall be
    installed by boring.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Detailed proposals for boring under carriageways or alternative
        underground methods proposed by the Contractor shall be submitted to
        the Superintendent for review two weeks prior to the programmed
        commencement of work.
        <s>
            <p>
            </p>
        </s>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, boring by water jetting will not be permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, the annulus between the bore and the pipe or
    carrier-conduit shall be filled by pressure grouting.
    <p>

<p>
    706.05 EXCAVATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the open trench method of crossing under a carriageway pavement is
    accepted, the line of the trench shall be straight, at right angles to the
    carriageway, and form the shortest link between terminals wherever
    practical. The width of trench shall be not greater than that necessary to
    carry out the work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The edges of all trenches located within a road pavement shall be sawcut.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any infrastructure located within the road reserve that is disturbed as a
    result of the work shall be reported immediately to the Superintendent and
    shall be reinstated promptly in consultation with the relevant
    infrastructure manager.

    Where the trench has been excavated from the nominated or designed subgrade
    level or above, the trench shall be backfilled up to the nominated or
    designed subgrade level with selected backfill material placed and
    compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm loose thickness, and above that
    level with common backfill material.
    <p>

    level, the trench shall be filled with selected backfill material placed
    and compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm loose thickness.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Bedding and Backfill (except pavement)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, bedding and backfill shall have during
    compaction a uniform moisture content within the range 85% to 115% of the
    optimum moisture content as determined in the Standard compactive effort.
    For backfill of nominal size greater than 40 mm the fraction of material
    passing the 37.5 mm sieve shall have during compaction a uniform moisture
    content within the range 85% to 115% of the optimum moisture content as
    determined for that fraction in the Standard compactive effort.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bedding and backfill shall be compacted to refusal using hand held
    mechanical equipment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Backfilling beneath areas to be paved shall be assessed for compaction in
    lots as defined in Section 173. The number of tests per lot shall be three.
    Backfill, the whole of which passes the 37.5 mm AS sieve, shall be
    compacted to a mean value of density ratio of not less than 97%. The
    calculation of density ratio shall be based on Standard compactive effort.
    A lot shall consist of a single layer of work. A minimum of 20% of all lots
    constructed shall be tested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Detailed proposals for the compaction of backfill materials of nominal
        size greater than 40 mm shall be submitted to the Superintendent for
        review before commencing work.

    (b) Pavement
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, pavement material shall have during compaction
    a uniform moisture content within the range 85% to 115% of the optimum
    moisture content as determined in the Modified compactive effort.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Pavement material shall be assessed for compaction in lots as defined in
    Section 173. The number of tests per lot shall be three. All pavement
    layers shall be compacted to a mean value of density ratio not less than
    the percentage specified in Clause 706.12(b). The calculation of density
    ratio shall be based on Modified compactive effort. All pavement layers
    shall be tested.

<p>
    Surplus excavated material shall be removed from the road reserve. Areas
    affected by the work shall be restored to a condition similar to that which
    existed prior to the commencement of the work.

    706.11 MAINTENANCE OF PAVEMENT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The reinstated surface shall be maintained in a trafficable condition after
    the completion of backfilling. Additional pavement material shall be placed
    in the trench and compacted as specified where in paved areas settlement or
    loss of material from the surface exceeds 20 mm measured from a straight
    edge laid across the top of the trench.
