    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The high friction surface treatment shall not emit offensive odours after
    opening to traffic, such that complaints are received by VicRoads. The
    Superintendent shall determine if the high friction surface treatment is
    producing offensive odours, and if the material is therefore unacceptable.
    The Superintendent's decision will be final.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    High Friction surface Treatment which is deemed to be unacceptable shall be
    rectified with the agreement of the Superintendent.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    430.05 SITE PREPARATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The existing pavement markings at the site may be covered by the surface
    treatment by the Contractor as part of the site preparation works, or may
    be masked to ensure the high friction surface treatment is not applied to
    the markings. All Raised Reflective Pavement Markers (RRPMs) may either be
    removed from the area of works prior to any high friction surface treatment
    being placed, or masked to ensure the high friction surface treatment is
    not applied to the RRPMs. All masking shall be removed prior to opening the
    site to traffic.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    All reinstatement of RRPMs and pavement markings shall be in accordance
    with Section 721.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any damage caused to the surface by the removal of pavement marking and
    RRPMS shall be repaired prior to placement of high friction surface
    treatment. The proposed methods of removal and repair shall be submitted to
    the Superintendent for approval.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All loose material, grit, stones, vegetative matter, and rubbish shall be
    removed from the area of works prior to placement of high friction surface
    treatment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The site may be further cleaned and prepared as required by the Contractor.
    Cleaning and preparation shall not cause structural damage to the pavement.
    All cleaning agents and collected material shall be removed from site in
    accordance with EPA requirements for the type of waste generated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    ##(stikeout this paragraph if not required):Cracks and sawcut traffic
    detector loops in the existing surface shall be masked with a maximum of 50
    mm total width of tape. The masking tape shall ensure high friction surface
    treatment is not placed over the cracks and detector loops, and shall be
    removed after the high friction surface treatment is placed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP High friction surface treatment shall not be placed until the
        Superintendent and Contractor agree the road surface is ready for
        surfacing.

    All excess material shall be removed from the site. The removal of loose
    aggregate and disposal from site is the responsibility of the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Excess aggregate shall be removed from the finished surface prior to
    opening the site to traffic. Excess aggregate shall be removed from the
    roadway, kerb and channel, driveways and any trafficked and untrafficked
    areas prior to opening to traffic.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The Contractor and Superintendent shall agree the site is neat, tidy
        and free of excess aggregate, prior to opening to traffic.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Material which becomes loose after the initial clean-up shall be removed at
    24 hours, 3 days and 14 days after placement unless otherwise directed by
    the Superintendent.

    430.09 ACCEPTANCE OF WORK
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    High friction surface treatment shall provide a visually uniform surface
    with uniform aggregate retention, and be free from delamination, stripping
    and areas of wear/scuffing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Surface Texture
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface texture of high friction surface treatment shall be a minimum
    of 0.6 mm as measured using VicRoads Surface Texture by Sand Patch. Each
    lot of material shall be tested within 2 weeks of initial placement, and
    within 8 weeks prior to the end of the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Skid Resistance
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The skid resistance of the high friction surface treatment shall be a
    minimum of 0.60 sfc during the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The length of entire site shall be tested using SCRIM &#174; in the left
    and right wheel paths in every through traffic lane of the site. The site
    shall be tested within 4 weeks of initial placement, and within 8 weeks
    prior to the end of the defects liability period. The Superintendent may
    undertake additional skid resistance testing of the site at any time during
    the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    VicRoads will undertake the skid resistance testing using SCRIM &#174;. The
    cost of the testing will be covered by VicRoads. A copy of the results will
    be available to the Contractor on request.

    430.10 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for monitoring and maintenance of the
    high friction surface treatment from the time of placement, until the end
    of the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out any works necessary to protect and maintain
    the surface, and effect repairs to all surface failures. Such failures
    include but are not limited to loss of aggregate, bleeding, fatty areas,
    flushing, loss of skid resistance, and delamination from the existing
    surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor is not responsible for defects caused by either settlement
    or failure of the existing pavement, or for damage (including gouging and
    vehicle fire) and repairs to the surface caused by traffic incidents.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Areas of delamination less than 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> are not required to be
    repaired, unless the total of defective areas exceeds 10% of any area.
    Areas of defect shall be agreed with the Superintendent. Areas shall be
    squared-up and extend to the width of the traffic lane. Defective high
    friction surface treatment shall be removed and replaced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Repairs shall be undertaken within 4 weeks of notification by the
    Superintendent. Urgent repairs shall be started onsite within 3 hours of
    notice by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The Contractor shall advise the Superintendent in writing of the
        proposed treatment for any repairs before undertaking the work.
