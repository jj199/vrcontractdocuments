    ##This section cross-references Section 407.
</p>
<p>
    If Section 407 is relevant, it should be included in the specification.

    40<a name="np402"></a>2.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for removal of pavement by cold
    planing including the cleaning up, removal and disposal of the excavated
    materials.
</p>
<p>
    402.02 COLD PLANING
</p>
<p>
    Cold planing shall be carried out in a manner as to leave a uniform surface
    on a plane parallel with the ultimate finished surface of the pavement as
    shown on the drawings.
</p>
<p>
    Cold planing machines have the following cutting drum characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        standard cutting drum with cutting tool spacing of 15 mm horizontally;
        and
    </li>
    <li>
        fine tooth drum with a cutting tool spacing of 8 mm (or less)
        horizontally.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The nominal depth and width of pavement to be removed shall be as specified
    in Clause 402.06. After planing, no point on the planed surface shall lie
    more than 15 mm below a 3 m straightedge placed on the planed surface in
    any direction.
</p>
<p>
    In locations where removal and replacement of asphalt or pavement is
    required on the same day, the rate of cold planing including clean up shall
    be at a rate consistent with the asphalt replacement process to minimise
    the pavement area closed to traffic.
</p>
<p>
    402.03 CLEANING UP AND DISPOSAL OF EXCAVATED MATERIAL
</p>
<p>
    The planed surface shall be swept clean of all loose material prior to
    either diverting traffic onto the planed surface or placing asphalt.
</p>
<p>
    The excavated material removed from the road shall either become the
    property of VicRoads, or the property of the Contractor, as specified in
    Clause 402.06.
</p>
<p>
    If the material becomes the property of VicRoads, the Contractor shall
    load, transport and stockpile material into a neat pile at the nominated
    stockpile area as specified in Clause 402.06(d).
</p>
<p>
    If the material becomes the property of the Contractor, the Contractor
    shall remove all such material from the site.
</p>
<p>
    Prior to opening to traffic, placing asphalt, or leaving the site, the
    Contractor shall present a clean planed surface.
</p>
<p>
    402.04 ASPHALT REPLACEMENT
</p>
<p>
    Where work under the Contract includes replacement of excavated material
    with asphalt supplied and placed under Section 407, the following
    requirements shall apply:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Exposed granular pavement material shall be watered, re&#8209;compacted
    and, where specified, primed or heavily tack coated, or for larger areas,
    given a bitumen emulsion primerseal prior to placing asphalt.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Prior to opening to traffic, excavated areas shall be filled with
    hotmix asphalt. All transverse and longitudinal joints shall be constructed
    as cold joints in accordance with Clause 407.17 and new asphalt shall be
    compacted flush with the existing pavement in accordance with the
    requirements of Clause 407.22(a).
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (c) In the event of a breakdown in the supply or placing of asphalt in
    areas to be opened to traffic, the Contractor shall temporarily backfill or
    ramp down the cold planed area with cold mix asphalt or other suitable
    material which will support traffic loading and provide for the safe
    passage of traffic. Material so placed shall be removed prior to placing
    new asphalt as specified and the placing and removal of temporary
    backfilling shall be at the expense of the Contractor. Temporary ramping
    shall be carried out to the standards specified in Clause 402.05.
</p>
<p>
    402.05 TEMPORARY RAMPING
</p>
<p>
    (a) Longitudinal Edges
</p>
<p>
    Any exposed longitudinal edges within the trafficked area shall be ramped
    down at a slope no steeper than 5 horizontal to 1 vertical by constructing
    a temporary wedge of hot mixed or cold mix asphalt.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Transverse Edges
</p>
<p>
    Any exposed transverse edges within the trafficked area shall be ramped
    down by constructing a temporary wedge of hot or cold mix asphalt.
    Temporary ramping shall not be steeper than 20 horizontal to 1 vertical for
    traffic speeds of more than 75 km/h or 10 horizontal to 1 vertical for
    traffic speeds of 75 km/h or less.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Removal of Temporary Ramping
</p>
<p>
    Before asphalt replacement, all temporary ramping shall be removed by
    cutting back along a straight line to expose a vertical face of fully
    compacted asphalt at the specified layer depth.
</p>
