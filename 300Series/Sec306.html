    This section covers the requirements for the delivery, spreading and
    compaction of plant mixed crushed rock and recycled crushed concrete for
    the construction of pavement subbase, treated with cementitious binder to
    produce a modified or bound subbase. This section is to be read in
conjunction with Section 815    <em>Cementitious Treated Crushed Rock for Pavement Subbase.</em>

    <strong>
        Cementitious Binder
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A cementitious material capable of being uniformly mixed into a granular
    pavement material to bind the particles together to increase its strength.
    Cementitious binders include Portland cement Type GP or blended cement Type
    GB, hydrated lime, quicklime, or a blend of ground granulated blast furnace
    slag (GGBFS), hydrated lime, fly ash, alkali activated slag or other
    pozzolanic material supplied in accordance with this specification.

    <strong>
        Maximum Allowable Working Time
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The maximum allowable working time for the cementitious binder as specified
    or as determined in accordance with the relevant Test Method or Code of
    Practice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Pavement Design Modulus
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The presumptive modulus used as the basis for the mechanistic design of a
    bound pavement with a bound cementitious treated crushed rock or crushed
    concrete subbase.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Working Time</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The time required to transport, place, compact and trim the pavement layer
    after the cementitious binder is added at the mixing plant.

<p>
    Pavement subbase shall be finished to a smooth and uniform surface and
    shall, after compaction, conform within the following limits to the levels,
    lines, grades, thicknesses and cross sections as specified or shown on the
    drawings.

    The width of pavement measured on each side of the centreline or design
    line shall not deviate by more than 50 mm from the designed offset when
    measured at a right angle.

<p>
    The surface level of the subgrade and pavement courses shall be measured in
    accordance with the requirements of Section 173 and every test lot shall
    meet either Scale A, B or C requirements as specified in Clause 306.12.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The maximum lot size for measurement and assessment of surface level shall
    be 4000 m<sup>2</sup>.

    Each level measurement shall be taken at random locations over the area of
    the lot in accordance with the VicRoads Test Method and the number of
    measurements taken within each lot shall not be less than the number
    specified in Table 306.031.

    For Scale A and Scale B level requirements, the Superintendent may accept a
    lot which does not conform with the limits of Table 306.032 at a reduced
    payment, in which case payment for the work will be reduced as shown in
    Table 306.033. The value of the lot of work shall be calculated from the
    unit rates for pavement construction as specified in Clause 306.12(b).

    less than 150 mm;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) longitudinal joints shall be located within 300 mm of the planned
    position of traffic lane lines or within 300 mm of the centre of a traffic
    lane.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If approval is given to depart from the joint location specified in
    306.08(a) to (e), the Contractor shall record of the location of these
    joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The edge of any paver run shall be kept moist until spreading and
    compaction have been completed in adjacent paver runs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Longitudinal and transverse joints shall be made where specified, or at the
    end of each day's work, or where spreading operations have been halted for
    a period in excess of the maximum allowable working time for the binder as
    specified in Clause 306.09 and Table 306.091. If the binder is not one of
    the binders listed in Table 306.091 the allowable working time for the
    binder shall be determined in accordance with the VicRoads Test Method.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Joints shall be made in a careful manner and shall be prepared immediately
    prior to the recommencement of spreading operations by cutting back the
    edge of previously laid material to a clean vertical face in compacted
    material of the full specified layer thickness. Longitudinal joints shall
    be constructed parallel to the centre line of the carriageway and
    transverse joints at right angles to the centre line.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    Material cut during the preparation of joints shall be removed from site.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The faces of all joints shall be thoroughly wetted immediately before
    spreading new material.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    The level and shape of the surface at all joints shall be within the limits
    specified in Clause 306.03.

    design modulus exceeding 500 MPa shall be placed in a single layer. The
    minimum compacted thickness shall be not less than 100 mm and the maximum
    compacted thickness shall be no more than 180 mm and constructed within the
    tolerances specified in Clause 306.03.

    seven days unless covered at an earlier stage with the succeeding layer or
    with an approved curing membrane.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction or other traffic shall not use a compacted layer within 24
    hours of placement without the approval of the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The subbase shall be kept in good order and condition and free from
    contamination.

<p>
    (i) cure the cementitious treated subbase by maintaining the surface in a
    moist condition<em> </em>for seven days;
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    (ii) prevent construction plant from using the pavement during the seven
    day curing period apart from that required to maintain and cure the
    surface; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) after the seven day curing period, restrict all construction traffic
    to vehicles with a maximum axle group load of 4 tonnes until asphalt base
    and intermediate courses are placed (priming, primersealing and asphalt
    placement activities excepted).

    Contractor shall:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) apply a size 7 CRS standard grade emulsion primerseal at a rate of
    application of 1.5 litres per square metre (0.9 litres per square metre of
    residual binder) to the cementitious treated subbase within 12 to 24 hours
    after completion of compaction. If after 24 hours ambient conditions are
    such the material has not dried back to less than 80% of the modified
    optimum moisture content, the primerseal shall be delayed until such time
    as the moisture content has reduced below 80% of optimum.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Subject to approval by the Superintendent and if weather conditions during
    the period from October to April inclusive suit priming, a light or very
    light cut back bitumen primer may be applied to the surface of the of the
    cementitious treated material in lieu of the emulsion primerseal. The rate
    of application of primer shall be a minimum of 0.6 litres per square metre
    and shall deliver a minimum of 0.3 to 0.4 litres per square metre of
    residual bitumen to the surface.

        HP Requests by the Contractor to vary the rates of application shall be
        submitted in writing to the Superintendent for review.

</p>
<p>
    Primersealing shall not be carried out within 12 hours of forecast rain and
    priming, if approved for use, shall not be carried out within 24 hours of
    forecast rain.
    <p>

    <strong>
        HP The Contractor's Environmental Management Plan shall include
        procedures to minimise all risks of damage to the environment
        associated with priming and primersealing.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) allow the cementitious treated subbase to cure for seven days without
    trafficking (except for the application of a prime or primerseal);
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) prevent construction plant from using the pavement during the seven
    day curing period apart from that required to maintain and cure the
    surface; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) after the seven days curing period, restrict construction traffic to
    vehicles with a maximum axle group load of 4 tonnes until asphalt base and
