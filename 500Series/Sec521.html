    521.03 CONCRETE PLACEMENT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, concrete shall be spread using a paver except
    for small areas where use of a paver is not practical in which case manual
    placement methods may be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall not be placed when the shade temperature is below 5&#176;C
    or above 35&#176;C and the temperature of concrete when placed shall be not
    less than 10&#176;C nor more than 30&#176;C. Concrete shall not be placed
    when rain is falling or when rain is expected within one hour of placing.
    The Contractor shall have available on site sufficient waterproof covers to
    protect concrete laid within 1 hour of rain falling. Covers when required
    shall be installed in such a manner as to not disturb the surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be placed, compacted and finished within 60 minutes of
    mixing except that when the shade temperature exceeds 30&#176;C the
    concrete shall be placed, compacted and finished within 45 minutes of
    mixing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Debonding of Subbase
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A size 5 mm bitumen emulsion seal shall be sprayed onto the subbase 48
    hours before the placement of concrete. The seal shall be applied in
    accordance with the requirements of Section 408.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Paving Rate
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The paver shall be operated such that its forward speed shall not be
    stopped due to lack of concrete. Should a essentially continuous rate of
    paving not be maintained, paving shall cease until appropriate remedial
    action is taken.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    521.04 COMPACTION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be uniformly compacted immediately after placement using a
    procedure which produces a dense layer having a uniformly textured surface
    and a profile satisfying the requirements of Clauses 521.02 and 521.08.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    521.05 JOINTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Joints shall be constructed as specified and shown on the drawings. Joints
    shall be straight and vertical and transverse joints shall be continuous
    from edge to edge of the pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Construction Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction joints shall be considered to be fresh joints when concrete on
    either side of the joint has been mixed within a 60 minute interval, or 45
    minute interval when the air temperature is over 30&#176;C, and provided
    the concrete does not show signs of setting. All other construction joints
    shall be considered to be cold construction joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Where set retarders are used the above times may be extended subject to
        review by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Longitudinal joints shall be constructed parallel to the centreline of the
    pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Fresh Construction Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction joints during a day's production shall be made as fresh
    joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For longitudinal joints, rolling shall not be carried out within 0.3 m of
    the proposed longitudinal joint during the first paver run. This initially
    uncompacted section shall be compacted together with the adjoining paver
    run.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For transverse joints, rolling of the initial strip shall be stopped 0.5 m
    from the proposed joint and this initially uncompacted section shall be
    compacted with the beginning of the succeeding run to form the joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Placement and compaction procedures shall be such that full depth
    compaction and the specified surface finish is achieved at the joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Cold Construction Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The work shall be organised to minimise the length of cold joints. A cold
    joint shall be formed when the adjoining concrete has been placed outside
    the time requirements specified in Clause 521.03 or where the adjoining
    concrete shows signs of setting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The edge of the previously placed concrete shall be cut back by sawing the
    concrete with a power concrete saw to at least one&#8209;third the slab
    depth but not exceeding one&#8209;third the slab depth plus 10 mm to expose
    an even, clean, sound, vertical surface for the full thickness of the
    pavement, without disturbing the concrete that is to remain in place.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cold joints shall have the same texture, full&#8209;depth density, and
    smoothness as specified for other sections of pavement. The edge of the
    previously laid concrete shall be cut back at least 200 mm from the top
    edge to expose a dense fully compacted edge. Trimming shall be carried out
    by cutting with power saw to a maximum depth of one&#8209;third the layer
    thickness and breaking off with hand tools without undercutting. The broken
    back surface shall be free from dust, sand, or other foreign material when
    the joint is formed. The face of a cold joint shall be covered with a
    cement slurry placed immediately in advance of paving and covered with
    concrete while the slurry is wet. Cement slurry shall consist of 3 parts
    water to 4 parts cement by volume.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cold transverse construction joints shall be constructed normal to the
    centre line and shall not be formed within 3.0 m of a planned contraction
    joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For cold longitudinal joints the screed of the paver shall overlap the
    previously placed paver run by 25 mm to 50 mm and shall be sufficiently
    high so that compaction will produce a smooth, dense joint. Any concrete
    placed by the paver on the edge of a previously placed paver run shall be
    pushed back by use of a rake to the edge of the paver run being placed.
    When the quantity of concrete on the edge of the previously placed paver
    run plus uncompacted material in the paver run being placed exceeds that
    required to produce a smooth, dense joint, the excess concrete shall be
    removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Transverse Sawn Contraction Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To prevent uncontrolled cracking in the base, sawn transverse contraction
    joints shall be constructed. Sawing shall commence as soon as the concrete
    has hardened sufficiently to permit cutting of the concrete without
    excessive tearing or ravelling regardless of time or weather conditions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified or shown on the drawings, joints shall be cut on
    a skew to the centreline of the pavement from the right side of the
    pavement and cross in the direction of design traffic flow at a 1 in 6
    skew. Joint spacing shall be 10.0 m &#177;0.3 m and the line of a sawn
    joint shall not deviate from a 3 m straight edge by more than 20 mm. The
    joints shall be constructed to the dimensions and details shown on the
    drawings initially formed as a sawn groove 3 mm wide to a depth not less
    than one&#8209;third the slab depth but not exceeding one&#8209;third the
    slab depth plus 10 mm. Joints shall be sawn in the sequence of concrete
    placement. Before sawing a joint, the base concrete shall be examined
    closely for cracks and the joints shall not be sawn within 1 m of a crack.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a crack develops ahead of the saw, sawing shall stop for that joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Sealing of Sawn Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Immediately after sawing, the joint groove and the adjacent concrete
    surface shall be thoroughly cleaned of all sawing detritus a continuous PVC
    spline seal 5 &#177; 1 mm in diameter shall be installed in the sawcut. The
    top of the seal shall not be less than 5 mm nor more than 7 mm below the
    surface of the base. Within 10 days of initial sawing the sawn joints shall
    be widened to not more than 7 mm, and deepened to a depth necessary to
    install the permanent seal. The widened sawn joint shall not exhibit more
    than 3 mm of edge ravelling at any point along the joint measured from the
    top surface. The permanent seal shall be installed immediately after the
    initial sawcut is widened and the joint thoroughly cleaned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Permanent seals shall either be neoprene compression type or an insitu cast
    silicone complying with Section 520.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The installation of neoprene compression seals shall not proceed when the
    shade temperature exceeds 20&#176;C. The joint groove into which the seal
    is to be inserted shall be clean and dry immediately prior to the
    installation of the seal. The sides of the neoprene seal shall be coated
    with a clear or concrete coloured lubricant&#8209;adhesive compound
    complying with ASTM D&#8209;2835 'Specification for Lubricant for
    Installation of Preformed Compression Seals in Concrete Pavement'. The seal
    shall not be over&#8209;stretched in order to fit into the groove and the
    maximum increase in length of the seal after installation shall be 5%. Any
    seal exceeding 5% extension shall be removed and replaced. The seal shall
    be continuous between longitudinal joints and where a discontinuity occurs
    the seal shall be butt jointed. The top of the seal shall be between 3 mm
    and 6 mm below the surface of the pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sealing with silicone sealant shall only take place when the side walls
    of the joint are surface dry and clean. Immediately prior to introducing
    the silicone into the joint a continuous polyethylene closed cell backer
    rod shall be installed in the joint as shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Expansion Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Expansion joints are generally formed around structures and features which
    project through, into or against the pavement and at other locations as
    specified. Transverse expansion joints shall not be constructed within 1.5
    m of a sawn contraction joint. Where necessary the spacing and skew of the
    adjacent transverse contraction joint may be altered to ensure sufficient
    clearance is obtained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Expansion joints shall be continuous across the full width of the base
    normal to the centreline and constructed in accordance with the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The joint gap shall be 20 mm running vertically for the full depth of the
    slab.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The top of the sealant shall be between 3 mm and 6 mm below the surface of
    the pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Details of the proposed sealant and the method of insertion shall be
        submitted to the Superintendent for approval at least 2 weeks before
        the commencement of installation.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may require a trial joint installation up to 2 m in
    length of any proposed sealant, to be carried out prior to accepting the
    proposed sealant and method of insertion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Multi&#8209;Layer Construction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where specified, the concrete shall be constructed in 2 layers of equal
    depth placed on the same day. If the time requirements given in Clause
    521.03 are exceeded a cement slurry shall be spread immediately in front of
    the paver at a uniform rate of 2 kg of cement slurry per square metre. Any
    wheel tracks made in the slurry shall be recovered with slurry. The slurry
    shall be covered with concrete while the slurry is wet. Cement slurry shall
    consist of 3 parts water to 4 parts cement by volume.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface layer shall be placed so that transverse and longitudinal
    construction joints coincide with construction joints in the bottom layer
    of the pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    521.06 CURING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing shall commence immediately after compaction is completed by keeping
    all surfaces of the concrete continuously wet. After the initial 12 hours
    of curing, the pavement shall be cured for a further 7 days by the
    application of a pigmented chlorinated rubber applied at an application
    rate of 0.3 l/m<sup>2</sup> curing compound. The curing compound shall
    comply with the requirements of Section 520.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any water applied to the surface of the concrete that is in excess of the
    amount needed to keep the surface of the concrete continuously wet, shall
    be controlled so as not to cause ponding on the concrete surface or erosion
    of the adjacent formation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water shall be applied to the concrete surface in a manner which will not
    cause erosion of the surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    521.07 FINAL SURFACE TEXTURE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface texture of the completed pavement shall be uniform over the
    whole pavement area and shall be totally free of any surface tears, pattern
    cracking, segregation, pumped areas, aggregate drag marks, areas loosened
    by construction operations, or areas where fines have been washed away
    during the curing process.
    <p>

    521.08 ASSESSMENT OF THICKNESS, COMPACTION AND STRENGTH
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be assessed in lots and all lots shall be tested. A lot
    shall consist of work constructed under essentially uniform conditions and
    is essentially homogeneous with regard to material and appearance. A lot
    shall normally consist of one day's work unless there has been a change in
    materials or mix proportions which could affect the uniformity of the lot,
    or there has been a substantial interruption to the construction process
    requiring a construction joint to be made. In such cases the work shall be
    split into more than one lot and each lot shall be assessed separately for
    compliance with the specification.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Cylinder Specimens
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall sample, prepare, cure and compression test the
    cylinders cast on site in accordance with AS 1012.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be sampled from the back of the paver. Each sample shall
    consist of one cylinder specimen for testing at age 28 days.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinder specimens shall be 100 mm diameter by 200 mm high and compacted
    using a vibratory hammer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A lot shall consist of ten samples.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall adopt an unbiased sampling program for the day's
    production. If the casting process is unexpectedly interrupted or
    terminated the samples taken to that time shall represent the lot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Density Testing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The saturated surface dry density of cylinder specimens (Cc) of a lot shall
    be determined in accordance with AS 1012 Part 12 at the same age at which
    the density of cores of the lot are determined. The mean cylinder density
    (Cc) of a lot shall be calculated using all the compressive test cylinder
    specimens in that lot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Cores
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Density testing shall be based on cores taken from the concrete pavement
    when it is 7 days old. The bounds of each lot for density and thickness
    testing shall be selected to coincide with the lots selected for
    compressive strength testing and, within the lot, sites for testing shall
    be selected on an essentially random basis except that no site shall be
    selected within 150 mm of a joint or slab edge. For each lot ten cores
    shall be taken.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cored specimens taken for density testing shall not be used if they are
    damaged during the coring operation or during transport. Rejected specimens
    shall be replaced with other specimens from the same lot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall restore core holes within 24 hours of cores being
    taken. The quality of concrete used for core hole restoration shall be
    equivalent in strength to the surrounding base concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface of the restored hole shall be similar to the surrounding
    concrete surface in texture and colour and shall be covered with a curing
    compound.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Density
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The saturated surface dry density of cores shall be determined in
    accordance with AS 1012 Part 12 and the mean core density (Cf) of the lot
    determined using all density test values from the cored samples in that
    lot.

</p>
<p>
    (d) Assessment of Compressive Strength
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Unadjusted Characteristic Strength (Du)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where 8 or more test values of 28 day compressive strength of a lot are
    available the characteristic strength of the lot shall be calculated to the
    nearest 0.1 MPa in the following manner:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Du = `x &#8209; ks
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where: Du = unadjusted characteristic strength of the lot
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
