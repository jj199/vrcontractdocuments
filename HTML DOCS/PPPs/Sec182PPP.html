</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1<a name="np182"></a>82.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section relates to pavement rutting measurement for all existing
    finished roadways which form part of the Project Assets.
</p>
<p>
    182.02 DEFINITIONS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pavement Reporting Section</strong>
    - As defined in the Project Scope and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Profilometer</strong>
    - Inertial laser profilometer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Project Road</strong>
    - As defined in the Project Scope and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Test Lane</strong>
    - Each through traffic lane that Project Co must maintain within a Pavement
    Reporting Section, excluding auxiliary lanes less than 500 metres.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rut Depth</strong>
    - The vertical pavement displacement, measured from a stringline taken
    between lane edges (lane rut depth) or across a wheel path (wheel path rut
    depth).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>100 m Section</strong>
    - A 100 metre length of pavement in a Test Lane, or a length greater than
    100 m where after taking into account all whole 100 m lengths of pavement
    in a Test Lane the remaining pavement length would otherwise be less than
    100 metres.
</p>
<p>
    182.03 MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF RUTTING
</p>
<p>
    (a) Scope of Testing
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise approved by the State, the surface of all pavements must
    be tested for rutting.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Lot Testing
</p>
<p>
    All work must be tested in Pavement Reporting Sections. Project Co must
    provide 24 hours notice to the Independent Reviewer (where applicable) and
    the State when rutting testing will be undertaken for each Pavement
    Reporting Section.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Measurement of Rutting
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must measure the transverse road surface profile of each Test
    Lane in accordance with Austroads Test Method-Measurements- AG:AM/T009.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Data Collection
</p>
<p>
    Data sampling for rutting measurement must take place at no more than 100
    millimetre intervals. Height measurement shall be at an accuracy of &#177;
    0.5 millimetres.
</p>
<p>
    The maximum wheel path rutting and lane rutting of each sampled profile
    shall be calculated by simulating the movement of a 1.2 metre and 3.0 metre
    straight edge respectively.
</p>
<p>
    Where the variation between the two outer-most lasers, on any one side of
    the transverse profile, exceeds 60 millimetres, it shall be assumed that an
    undesirable edge condition has been encountered and the profile shall
    exclude the outer most point.
</p>
<p>
    The inertial laser profilometer equipment to be used must meet the minimum
    requirements in Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T009.
</p>
<p>
    The profilometer must be calibrated in accordance with the calibration
    procedure contained in Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T009.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (e) Profilometer Equipment Validation
</p>
<p>
    Equipment shall be validated in accordance with Austroads Test Method
    AG:AM/T010.
</p>
<p>
    At any stage during the collection of data, the last successfully passed
    validation must be within the last 12 months.
</p>
<p>
    Separate validations must be undertaken for each vehicle used to collect
    data.
</p>
<p>
    In accordance with Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T009, Austroads Test Method
    AG:AM/T010 validation procedure must be adopted for the validation, and its
    check limits passed.
</p>
<p>
    (f) Calculation of Rutting
</p>
<p>
    Rutting shall be calculated as the result of analysis of the actual
    transverse road profile of each wheel path and lane.
</p>
<p>
    Lane rutting shall be calculated from the full transverse profile using the
    3.0 m straight edge for each 100 m Section.
</p>
<p>
    Wheel path rutting shall be calculated from the left and right profiles on
    the respective side of the centreline including the centreline point by
    simulating the maximum rut depth under a 1.2 m straight edge for each 100 m
    Section.
</p>
<p>
    Reference shall be made to Austroads Guide to Asset Management Part 5 C:
    Rutting for guidelines for deriving results based on collected transverse
    road profile.
</p>
<p>
    (g) Reporting of Test Results
</p>
<p>
    Results must be processed and reported for each 100 m Section. Any
    sub&#8209;sections less than 100 m must be included with the
    sub&#8209;section immediately preceding it and the individual rutting
    calculated over the longer sub&#8209;section.
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must provide the Independent Reviewer (where applicable) and the
    State with a copy of all test results representing the final rutting survey
    of each test, together with the calculated values of the mean lane rutting
    value for each Pavement Reporting Section, each 100 m Section and all other
    information required by the Project Scope and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Rutting results shall be reported in 100 metre lengths for the lane
    surveyed, for both the left and right wheel paths, and recorded in the
    following formats:
</p>
<p>
    (i) the average of left wheel path rutting in mm
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the average of right wheel path rutting in mm
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the average of lane rutting in mm.
</p>
<p>
    The average lane rutting in mm for each Pavement Reporting Section shall be
    the mean of the lane rutting for all 100 m Sections of all Test Lanes
    within a Pavement Reporting Section.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Toc455661084">(h) Measurement Repeatability and Bias</a>
</p>
<p>
    Assessment of the repeatability of measurements and bias error must be
    undertaken in accordance with Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T012 as part of
    the validation process prior to each annual data collection and
    measurement.
