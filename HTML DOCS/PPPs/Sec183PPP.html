<p>
    This section relates to Skid Resistance measurement for all existing

</p>
<p>
    183.02 DEFINITIONS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5 m Section</strong>
    - means a 5-metre length of pavement in a Test Lane, or a length greater
    than 5 metres where after taking into account all whole 5 m lengths of
    pavement in a Test Lane the remaining pavement length would otherwise be
    less than 5 metres.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Left SFC</strong>
    - Sideways Force Coefficient measured in the left wheelpath and reported in
    5 m Section data.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Project Road</strong>
    - As defined in the Project Scope and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Processed SFC</strong>
    - The minimum of the four-point rolling average of 5 m Section SFC data
    within a Skid Resistance Section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Processed Differential Friction Level (DFL)</strong>
    - The maximum difference between the four-point rolling average of Left SFC
    and adjacent four-point rolling average of Right SFC within a Skid
    Resistance Section.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Right SFC</strong>
    - Sideways Force Coefficient measured in the right wheelpath and reported
    in 5 m Section data
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk14257875"><strong>SFC</strong></a>
    - Sideways Force Coefficient; the measure of Skid Resistance, being the
    ratio of the sideways forces to the vertical reaction on the test wheel
    recorded as an individual measurement for a single sub-section of pavement
    surface 5 meters long.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Skid Resistance - A condition parameter that characterises the
        condition that a road surface alone makes
    </strong>
    to the total level of friction available at the contact patch between the
    road surface and vehicle tyre during acceleration, breaking, and
    manoeuvres.
</p>
<p>
    Skid Resistance Sites - As defined in the Project Scope and Delivery
    Requirements.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Skid Resistance Section </strong>
    - The extent of pavement included in a Skid Resistance Site.

    183.03 MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF SKID RESISTANCE
</p>
<p>
    (a) Scope of Testing
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise approved by the State, the surface of all pavements within
    Skid Resistance Sections must be tested for Skid Resistance.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Measurement of Skid Resistance
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must measure the SFC condition of all pavements within Skid
    Resistance Sections in accordance with VicRoads sideways-force coefficient
    measurement device test method or suitable alternative as agreed by the
    State.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Data Collection
</p>
<p>
    The equipment used shall measure Skid Resistance using the sideways-force
    method over the appropriate range of operating speeds in both wheel paths.
</p>
<p>
    Data sampling for skid resistance measurement must take place continuously
    and be stored at no more than 5 m intervals.
</p>
<p>
    The equipment to be used must meet the minimum requirements in the
    manufacturer's instruction for the test device and in all applicable State
    and Austroads documents.
</p>
<p>
    The equipment must be calibrated in accordance with the calibration
    procedure contained in the manufacturer's instruction for the test device
    and in accordance with all applicable State and Austroads documents.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (e) Skid Resistance Equipment Validation
</p>
<p>
    Measurements made by the equipment shall be compared against historical
    data collected over a validation loop/site(s) specified by the State. The
    validation loop/site(s) shall cover a range of skid resistance. The minimum
    correlation coefficient for sideways force coefficient values measured by
    the equipment and historical data shall be greater than or equal to 0.7.
</p>
<p>
    At any stage during the collection of data, the last successfully passed
    validation must be within the last 12 months.
</p>
<p>
    Separate validations must be undertaken for each vehicle used to collect
    data.
</p>
<p>
    (f) Calculation of SFC
</p>
<p>
    SFC values shall be adjusted with all recognised correction factors as per
    the manufacturers instruction for the test device and in accordance with
    all applicable State and Austroads documents, and expressed as a positive,
    unsigned integer.
</p>
<p>
    (g) Calculation of Processed SFC
</p>
<p>
    Processed SFC shall be calculated by taking the minimum of the four-point
    rolling SFC average within each Skid Resistance Section. The Skid
    Resistance for each Skid Resistance Section shall be calculated in
    accordance with VicRoads sideways-force coefficient measurement device test
    method or suitable alternative as agreed by the State.
</p>
<p>
    (h) Calculation of Processed DFL
</p>
<p>
    Processed DFL shall be calculated by taking the maximum difference between
    the four-point rolling average of Left SFC and adjacent four-point rolling
    average of Right SFC within a Skid Resistance Section.
</p>
<p>
    (i) Reporting of Test Results
</p>
<p>
    All test results shall be reported in 5 m intervals and in accordance with
    VicRoads sideways-force coefficient measurement device test method or
    suitable alternative as agreed by the State.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Results shall also be reported as Processed SFC per Skid Resistance
        Section.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <a name="_Toc455661084">(j) Measurement Repeatability and Bias</a>
</p>
<p>
    The repeatability of skid resistance measurements must be assessed by
    undertaking a minimum of 5 runs over the validation loop/site(s) specified
    by the State as part of the validation process prior to each annual data
    collection and measurement. The minimum correlation coefficient for
    sideways force coefficient values measured at each loop/site shall be
    greater than or equal to 0.9.
