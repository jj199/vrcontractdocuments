</p>
<p>
    1<a name="np181"></a>81.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section relates to pavement ride quality measurement for all existing
    finished roadways which form part of the Project Assets.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    181.02 DEFINITIONS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>International Roughness Index (IRI<sub>qc</sub>)</strong>
    - The international measure of ride quality measured and recorded by modern
    Class 1 profile measuring devices in cumulative metres per kilometre in
    each wheel path and averaged together. For the purposes of this definition,
    roughness measurement is to be based on the IRI<sub>qc</sub> quarter car
    model.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Individual Lane Roughness Value</strong>
    - The mean value of the two wheel path IRI<sub>qc</sub> values measured on
    a 100 m sub&#8209;section of a traffic lane.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pavement Reporting Section</strong>
    - As defined in the Project Scope and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Test Lane</strong>
    - Each through traffic lane that Project Co must maintain within a Pavement
    Reporting Section, excluding auxiliary lanes less than 500 metres.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>10 m Section</strong>
    - A 10 metre length of pavement in a Test Lane, or a length greater than 10
    m where after taking into account all whole 10 m lengths of pavement in a
    Test Lane the remaining pavement length would otherwise be less than 10
    metres.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>100 m Section</strong>
    - A 100 metre length of pavement in a Test Lane, or a length greater than
    100 m where after taking into account all whole 100 m lengths of pavement
    in a Test Lane the remaining pavement length would otherwise be less than
    100 metres.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Feature</strong>
    - A length of pavement influenced by the presence of geometric or other
    features within the roadway such as rail crossings, tram tracks, bridge
    abutments or roundabouts as nominated in the Feature Inventory.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Feature Section</strong>
    - A 10 m Section of pavement of which any portion contains a Feature
    included in the Feature Inventory.
</p>
<p>
    Feature Inventory - As defined in the Project Scope and Delivery
    Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    181.03 MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF RIDE QUALITY
</p>
<p>
    (a) Scope of Testing
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise approved by the State, the surface of all pavements must
    be tested for ride quality.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Lot Testing
</p>
<p>
    All work must be tested in Pavement Reporting Sections. Project Co must
    provide 24 hours notice to the Independent Reviewer (where applicable) and
    the State when ride quality testing will be undertaken for each Pavement
    Reporting Section.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Measurement of Ride Quality
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must measure the longitudinal road surface profile of each Test
    Lane in accordance with Austroads Test Method-Measurements-AG:AM/T001.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Data Collection
</p>
<p>
    The equipment used shall measure longitudinal road profile simultaneously
    in both wheel paths over the wavelength range of 0.5 metres to 50 metres
    over the appropriate range of operating speeds.
</p>
<p>
    Data sampling for roughness measurement must take place at no more than 50
    millimetre intervals. Height measurement shall be at an accuracy of &#177;
    0.2 millimetres. Each wheel path profile shall be analysed by simulating
    the travel of a "quarter&#8209;car" model to determine the roughness for
    each wheel path.
</p>
<p>
    The inertial laser profilometer equipment to be used must meet the minimum
    requirements in Austroads Test Method AG AM/T001.
</p>
<p>
    The profilometer must be calibrated in accordance with the calibration
    procedure contained in Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T001.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Profilometer Equipment Validation
</p>
<p>
    Equipment shall be validated in accordance with Austroads Test Method
    AG:AM/T001.
</p>
<p>
    At any stage during the collection of data, the last successfully passed
    validation must be within the last 12 months.
</p>
<p>
    Separate validations must be undertaken for each vehicle used to collect
    data.
</p>
<p>
    In accordance with Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T001, Austroads Test Method
    AG:AM/T003 validation procedure must be adopted for the validation, and its
    check limits passed.
</p>
<p>
    (f) Calculation of Roughness
</p>
<p>
    Roughness shall be calculated as the result of analysis of the actual
    longitudinal road profile of each wheel path.
</p>
<p>
    The roughness for each 100 m Section and Pavement Reporting Section shall
    be calculated in accordance with Clause 7 of Austroads Test Method
    AG:AM/T001. IRI results must be reported to two decimal places (m/km), and
    NRM shall be rounded to the nearest integer (counts/km).
</p>
<p>
    (g) Reporting of Test Results
</p>
<p>
    All reporting of test results shall be in accordance with Austroads
    Specification AG:AM/S001 except:
</p>
<p>
    (i) survey data shall be marked as invalid if more than 20% of the data
    within a 10 m Section is collected:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        when the road surface is wet; or
    </li>
    <li>
        outside the speed constraints of the equipment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The figure of 20% in clause (g)(i) above replaces the figure of 50% in
    Austroads Specification AG:AM/S001 under the heading Data Flag.
</p>
<p>
    A 100 m Section shall be marked as containing invalid survey data if more
    than 20% of the 10 m Sections contained within a 100 m Section are invalid.
</p>
<p>
    Results shall be processed and reported initially into 10 m Sections. The
    10m Sections shall then be processed and reported in 100 m Sections.
</p>
<p>
    The IRI values for each 100 m Section shall be the average IRI value of all
    10 m Sections within the 100 m Section which do not contain invalid data
    and are not Feature Sections.
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must provide the Independent Reviewer (where applicable) and the
    State with a copy of all test results representing the final roughness
    survey of each test, together with the calculated values of the mean lane
    roughness value for each Pavement Reporting Section, each 10 m Section,
    each 100 m Section, and all other information required by the Project Scope
    and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Reporting unit for the left and right wheel path roughness shall be
    International Roughness Index (IRI) (m/km). The lane roughness shall be
    reported in IRI and NAASRA Roughness Meter (NRM) (counts/km).
</p>
<p>
    Roughness results shall be reported for each 100 m Section, for both the
    left and right wheel paths, and recorded in the following formats:
</p>
<p>
    (i) the average of left wheel path roughness in IRI;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the average of right wheel path roughness in IRI; and
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the average of lane roughness in IRI and NRM.
</p>
<p>
    When the Mean Value of Lane Roughness for a 100 m Section is greater than
    7.6 IRI (200 NRM), lane roughness must be reported as 7.6 IRI (200 NRM).
</p>
<p>
    The mean lane roughness value for each Pavement Reporting Section shall be
    the mean of the IRI calculations of the lane roughness for all 100 m
    Sections of all Test Lanes within a Pavement Reporting Section.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Toc455661084">(h) Measurement Repeatability and Bias</a>
</p>
<p>
    Assessment of the repeatability of measurements and bias error must be
    undertaken in accordance with Austroads Test Method AG:AM/T004 as part of
    the validation process prior to each annual data collection and
    measurement.
