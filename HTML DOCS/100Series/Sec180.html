    SECTION 180 - RIDE QUALITY FOR PAVEMENTS
</p>
<p>
    ##This section cross-references Section 175, which should be included in
    the specification. If Section 175 is not included in the specification, all
    references to it should be struck out, ensuring that the remaining text is
    still coherent:
</p>
<p>
    18<a name="np180"></a>0.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section relates to ride quality performance for pavement construction.
</p>
<p>
    The locations specified in Table 180.091 are exempt from lot testing under
    this Contract.
</p>
<p>
    180.02 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
</p>
<p>
    The finished surface of the pavement shall have a smooth longitudinal
    profile and comply with the minimum ride quality requirements specified.
    The upper limits for roughness at various locations are specified in Table
    180.092.
</p>
<p>
    180.03 DEFINITIONS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Continuous Traffic Lane - </strong>
    A length of traffic lane which can be tested in a single test run
    uninterrupted by areas exempted from ride quality assessment.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>International Roughness Index (IRI<sub>qc</sub>) - </strong>
    The international measure of ride quality measured and recorded by modern
    Class 1 profile measuring devices in cumulative metres per kilometre in
    each wheel path and averaged together. For the purposes of this
    specification, roughness measurement is to be based on the IRI<sub>qc</sub>
    quarter car model.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Individual Lane Roughness Value</strong>
    - The mean value of the two wheel path IRI<sub>qc</sub> values measured on
    a 100 m sub&#8209;section of a traffic lane.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mean Lane Roughness Value</strong>
    - The mean of the Individual Lane Roughness Values within the lot as
    determined by the appropriate test method.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Measuring Device</strong>
    - The device used for measurement of roughness shall be:
</p>
<p>
    (a) capable of measuring the longitudinal road surface profile along one or
    both wheel paths at least every 250 mm with a precision in elevation of 0.5
    mm over a wave band of 1 to 30 metres;
</p>
<p>
    (b) calibrated according to the relevant test methods.
</p>
<p>
    180.04 MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF RIDE QUALITY
</p>
<p>
    (a) Scope of Testing
</p>
<p>
    Unless noted otherwise in Table 180.091, the surface of all pavement
    construction shall be tested for ride quality.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Lot Testing
</p>
<p>
    All work shall be tested in lots of continuous traffic lane. A lot shall be
    defined as the length and width of each continuous traffic lane constructed
    including any freeway ramps but excluding shoulders and turn lanes. The
    Contractor shall provide 24 hours notice to the Superintendent of when ride
    quality testing will be undertaken and the limits for each lot.
</p>
<p>
    The maximum length of the lot shall be restricted to 2 km of continuous
    traffic lane.
</p>
<p>
    The minimum length of the lot shall be the lesser of the total job length
    or 500 m.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (c) Measurement of Ride Quality
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall measure the longitudinal road surface profile of each
    lot in accordance with the relevant Test Method applicable to the
    particular test equipment being used as listed in Section 175.
</p>
<p>
    Ride quality measurement shall be undertaken within three months after the
    application of the surfacing.
</p>
<p>
    *** ##(strikethrough if this paragraph not applicable):For contracts with a
    Defects Liability Period of two years or more, measurement of ride quality
    shall be repeated no earlier than three months or later than one month
    before the end of the Defects Liability Period.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Reporting of Test Results
</p>
<p>
    Results shall be processed and reported for each 100 m sub&#8209;section.
    Any sub&#8209;sections less than 100 m shall be included with the
    sub&#8209;section immediately preceding it and the individual roughness
    calculated over the longer sub&#8209;section. The Contractor shall provide
    the Superintendent with a copy of all test results representing the final
    roughness survey of completed pavement together with the calculated values
    of the individual and mean lane roughness for each lot.
</p>
<p>
    180.05 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall comply with the requirements for both the Maximum
    Individual Lane Roughness and Maximum Mean Lane Roughness as follows:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Individual Lane Roughness
</p>
<p>
    Where an Individual Lane Roughness Value in any 100 m sub&#8209;section is
    greater than the specified Maximum Individual Lane Roughness Value
    specified in Table 180.092, the Contractor shall rectify work within the
    sub&#8209;section to comply with this requirement. The minimum length of
    rectification work undertaken shall be 100 m.
</p>
<p>
    All rectified 100 m sub&#8209;sections shall be re&#8209;tested following
    completion of rectification work.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Mean Lane Roughness
</p>
<p>
    Where the Mean Lane Roughness Value of a lot is greater than the Mean Lane
    Roughness specified in Table 180.092, the work shall be rectified unless
    the Superintendent agrees to accept the work at a reduced payment. Where
    the lot is to be rectified, the minimum length for any rectification work
    undertaken shall be 100 m. Where the Superintendent agrees to accept the
    lot at a reduced payment, a deduction to the contract sum shall be made in
    accordance with Clause 180.06.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall re&#8209;test the lot following completion of any
    rectification work.
</p>
<p>
    180.06 PAYMENT DEDUCTION PROVISIONS
</p>
<p>
    Where a deduction in payment is to be made for failure to comply with the
    specified Maximum Mean Lane Roughness for a lot, the deduction shall be
    made in accordance with the following formula:

    180.07 PAYMENT RETENTION
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contractor is required to carry out measurement of ride quality
    within three months of the end of the Defects Liability Period, retention
    of payment shall apply.
</p>
<p>
    The amount of retention shall be calculated using the following formula:
</p>
<p>
Retention ($) = 0.03 (A<sub>1</sub> x C<sub>1</sub> + A<sub>2</sub> x C    <sub>2</sub> + . . . . . ) + E
</p>
<p>
    where: A<sub>1</sub> = the total area of pavement with the same unit cost
    as shown in Table 180.093
</p>
<p>
    C<sub>1</sub> = the appropriate unit cost from Table 180.093
</p>
<p>
    E = an amount equal to the value of deductions calculated using Clause
    180.06 and the test results at Practical Completion
</p>
<p>
    180.08 PAVEMENT RECTIFICATION
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall bear the full cost of any necessary rectification work
    including the cost of any additional work required to the underlying or
    adjacent pavement to comply with this section. All rectification work shall
    be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the specification.
