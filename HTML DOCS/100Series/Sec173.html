    SECTION 173 &#8209; EXAMINATION AND TESTING OF MATERIALS AND WORK
    (ROADWORKS)
</p>
<p>
    173<a name="np173">.</a>01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section covers some of the requirements for examination and testing of
    materials and work associated with road construction. Particular
    examination and testing requirements are separately specified in the
    relevant sections of the specification. Unless otherwise specified, the
    cost of all testing shall be borne by the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    173.02 LOT TESTING
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, acceptance of material and work will be based
    on testing of the material or work in lots. A lot will consist of a single
    layer, batch or area of like work which has been constructed or produced
    under essentially uniform conditions and is essentially homogeneous with
    respect to material and appearance. Unless otherwise specified, the extent
    of each lot shall not exceed one day's production. Discrete portions of a
    lot which are non&#8209;homogeneous with respect to material and appearance
    shall be excluded from the lot and shall be either treated as separate
    lots, or reworked. Where the areas excluded from a lot as
    non&#8209;homogeneous exceed 10% of the total lot area or at other
    specified percentages of the total lot area, the whole of the lot shall be
    rejected.
</p>
<p>
    173.03 TEST ROLLING
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall submit a test rolling procedure to the Superintendent
    including the method of preparing an area for test rolling, the extent of
    test rolling and a requirement to provide not less than 24 hours notice of
    the location and commencement time for the test rolling to the
    Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    Plant which is nominated for use in test rolling procedures shall comply
    with the following requirements:
</p>
<p>
    (i) Static smooth steel wheeled rollers shall have a mass of not less than
    12 tonnes and a load intensity under either the front or rear wheels of not
    less than 6 tonnes per metre width of wheel.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Pneumatic tyred plant shall have a mass of not less than 20 tonne and
    shall have a ground contact pressure under either the front or rear wheels
    of not less than 450 kPa per tyre. The area over which this ground contact
    pressure shall be applied shall not be less than 0.035 m<sup>2</sup> per
    tyre.
</p>
<p>
    Each layer should be test rolled immediately following completion of
    compaction but if test rolling is carried out at a later time the surface
    of the layer shall be watered and given a minimum of three passes with the
    test roller prior to commencement of test rolling.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Compliance
</p>
<p>
    Compliance with the test rolling requirements shall be when an area
    withstands test rolling without visible deformation or springing.
</p>
<p>
    173.04 COMPACTION AND MOISTURE CONTENT TESTING
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    For the purpose of control of moisture content of material and for
    determination of compaction procedure the following definitions shall
    apply:
</p>
<p>
    (i) material of nominal size 40 mm or less:
</p>
<p>
    material which has 20% or less (by wet mass) retained on a 37.5 mm AS sieve
</p>
<p>
    (ii) material of nominal size greater than 40 mm:
</p>
<p>
    material which has more than 20% (by wet mass) retained on a 37.5 mm AS
    sieve.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (b) Definition of Density Ratio for Asphalt and Concrete Pavement
</p>
<p>
    Density ratio is defined as follows:
</p>
<p>
    (i) Asphalt Pavement
</p>
<p>
    The percentage ratio of the field bulk density to the bulk density of the
    job design mix when compacted in the laboratory.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Concrete Pavement
</p>
<p>
    The percentage ratio of the field bulk density to the mean bulk density of
    cylinder specimens taken from the same lot.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Characteristic Value of Density Ratio or Moisture Ratio
</p>
<p>
    The characteristic value of density ratio or moisture ratio of the lot
    shall be calculated as`x &#8209; 0.92S for six tests per lot where`x and S
    are respectively the mean and the standard deviation of the individual
    density ratio or moisture ratio test values respectively for the lot.
</p>
<p>
    The mean of density ratio or moisture ratio is defined by:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="68"
        height="47"
        src="file:////Users/joel_joy/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.jpg"
    />
</p>
<p>
    The standard deviation of density ratio or moisture ratio test values is
    defined by:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="103"
        height="54"
        src="file:////Users/joel_joy/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg"
    />
</p>
<p>
    where x<sub>i</sub>, i=1, 2, 3, .....n, is the individual density ratio or
    moisture ratio test value and n is the number of tests per lot.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Testing Small Areas
</p>
<p>
    For earthworks and pavement construction any lot which has a surface area
    less than 500 m<sup>2</sup> may be treated as a small area. When testing a
    small area as a lot and where test requirements are based on characteristic
    values of density ratio and/or moisture ratio, acceptance of the lot shall
    be based on the mean values of 3 individual tests. In this case the lot
    will be accepted as far as compaction is concerned if the mean value of the
    individual tests exceeds by 2.0% or more the appropriate compaction scale
    requirement for the characteristic value of density ratio for a lot of six
    tests.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Samples Containing Oversize Material with a Nominal Size Greater than
    40 mm
</p>
<p>
    (i) Assessment Based on Characteristic Density Ratio
</p>
<p>
    If the set of six samples includes no more than two samples having more
    than the permitted amount of 40 mm nominal size material, the lot will be
    accepted as far as compaction is concerned if the mean value of the
    individual tests exceeds the specified characteristic value of density
    ratio by 2.0% or more. If there are less than 4 valid samples, acceptance
    shall be based on the adoption of an acceptable compaction procedure and
    test rolling carried out in accordance with the requirement of this
    Specification.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Assessment Based on Mean Density Ratio
</p>
<p>
    If the set of three samples includes one or more samples having more than
    the permitted amount of material exceeding 40 mm in nominal size,
    assessment shall be based on the adoption of an acceptable compaction
    procedure and test rolling carried out in accordance with the requirement
    of this Specification.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (f) Refilling Test Holes
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall backfill test holes with material of similar quality
    to that removed from test holes during testing. The backfill material shall
    be compacted in the holes in layers with a suitable compaction device.
</p>
<p>
    (g) Moisture Ratio Determination
</p>
<p>
    For material of nominal size greater than 40 mm, moisture ratio shall be
    determined on that fraction of the material which passes the 19.0 mm AS
    sieve.
</p>
<p>
    For material of nominal size 40 mm or less, moisture ratio shall be
    determined on the whole material, taking into account any adjustment for
    oversize material as detailed in the relevant test method.
</p>
<p>
    (h) Acceptance Testing
</p>
<p>
    All compaction testing of work carried out under this Contract shall be
    deemed to be testing for acceptance unless written advice is provided to
    the Superintendent prior to the commencement of the test, that such testing
    is for in&#8209;process monitoring only. Where the Contractor provides
    prior written advice to this effect, the results of such testing will not
    be allowable as testing for acceptance.
