    <strong>PART A - QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    161.A1 THE QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall plan, develop and maintain a documented quality
    management system in accordance with this Specification and with Australian
    Standard AS/NZS ISO 9001 ‘Quality management systems – Requirements’ except
    for requirements of Clause 7.3 Design and Development.
</p>
<p>
    The quality management system shall cover all work under the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    161.A2 HOLD POINTS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong>
    Those points beyond which the work may not proceed without review by the
    Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
Hold points are identified in the specification by the letters    <strong>HP</strong> in the left margin and by bold text print or arise from
    non‑conformances.
</p>
<p>
    The review by the Superintendent of a hold point will not relieve the
    Contractor of responsibility for satisfactory execution or performance of
    the work.
</p>
<p>
    Text which is bolded but not identified by the letters <strong>HP</strong>
    in the left margin is not a Hold Point. These are specified obligations on
    the Contractor requiring the review or approval of the Superintendent. They
    are bolded for ease of identification.
</p>
<p>
    161.A3 QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DOCUMENTS
</p>
<p>
    Further to the General Conditions of Contract, the Contractor shall submit
    for consideration by the Superintendent the following:
</p>
<p>
    *** (a) a controlled copy of the contract specific quality plan within ##:
    weeks of the date of acceptance of the tender, i.e. a document setting out
    the specific quality practices, resources, activities and responsibilities
    relevant to the Contract;
</p>
<p>
    (b) specific quality procedures/descriptions relating to the work not less
    than 14 days prior to the commencement of that work. However, for works
    proposed at the commencement of the Contract for which 14 days is not
    possible, a period of 4 working days will be accepted.
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified quality plans are not required for annual supply
    contracts.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    161.A4 ADDITIONAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall comply with the specified Australian Standard for
    quality management systems. In addition, the following requirements shall
    be satisfied:
</p>
<p>
    (a) For AS/NZS ISO 9001
</p>
<p>
    (i) Identification: the Contractor shall identify all test results with the
    precise locations to which they relate.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Traceability: traceability is not required unless otherwise specified.
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Testing: the frequency of testing shall be adequate to demonstrate
    compliance with the Specification. In some instances, the minimum frequency
    of testing is covered in the Specification.
</p>

<p>
    (b) Non‑conformance
</p>
<p>
    All non‑conformances, where the disposition of the non‑conformance violates
    the contractual requirements, are to be promptly reported to the
    Superintendent for agreement via non‑conformance reports. Such
    non‑conformances automatically create hold points.
</p>
<p>
    Further, all non‑conformance reports shall include:
</p>
<p>
    (i) the cause of the non‑conformance;
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the proposed method of rectifying the non‑conformance; and
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the proposed changes made to the work procedures to prevent a
    recurrence.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Audits
</p>
<p>

    Final Certificate whichever is earlier, the Contractor shall make available
    a register of all records held. The Contractor shall provide the
    Superintendent with a copy of such records, or part thereof, as requested.
</p>
<p>
    Within 12 weeks of the Date of Practical Completion, and before issue of
    the Final Certificate whichever is earlier, the Contractor shall provide
    as‑constructed drawings, in accordance with the following requirements:
</p>
<p>
    *** (a) ##: as‑constructed drawings with departures clearly marked, shall
    show the Works as constructed;
</p>
<p>
    *** (b) ##:the location of services within the limits of the work shall be
    clearly marked.
</p>
<p>
    ## (this is not practical for sprayed sealing and asphalt resurfacing
    contracts - it really applies to new pavement constructions, and bridge
    works):
</p>
<p>
    161.A6 SURVEILLANCE AND AUDITS BY VICROADS
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent will arrange surveillance and audits to ensure that the
    Contractor is complying with the Quality and Environmental Management
    System/Plan.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall, upon being given reasonable notice by the
    Superintendent, make or arrange to be available all facilities,
    documentation, records and personnel, including those of any
    sub‑contractors, that are reasonably required for the audit or surveillance
    to be undertaken.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding that VicRoads may have previously undertaken audits of a
    sub‑contractor's quality management system in connection with other work,
    the Contractor shall include the operations of all such sub‑contractors in
    the Contract quality plan and shall fulfil all the quality obligations of
    the Contract.
</p>
<p>
    VicRoads will carry out audit and surveillance of the work of all
    sub‑contractors as it sees fit, in the same way that it may carry out audit
    and surveillance of all work done, and materials supplied by the
    Contractor. The Superintendent may for this purpose have recourse to audit
    and surveillance carried out for other VicRoads contracts. Copies of any
    such audit and surveillance reports used by the Superintendent will be
    provided to the Contractor.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    The contract sum will be deemed to include the cost of all wages and other
    costs arising from the requirements of the awards, certified agreements and
    enterprise flexibility agreements to which it is bound, and no adjustment
    will be made to the contract on account of such requirements or any new
    matter introduced into an award, or any certified agreement or enterprise

    due to industrial action and shall also inform the Superintendent of
    measures being taken to resolve such action.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall make no claim against VicRoads for any costs, loss,
    expense or damage arising from any industrial action resulting in a strike,
    work stoppage, work ban or work limitations of any kind.

        has been provided to the Superintendent, and the Health and Safety
        Co-ordination Plan as required by Section 168 has been submitted to the
        Superintendent for review.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>

    grounds for an extension of time for completion of the Works or any part
    thereof, nor shall it form the basis of any claim for additional payment.
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent will consult with the Contractor to establish the date
    of commencement of the work, or separable part of the work, and will
    confirm in writing the date so agreed. If agreement as to the date of
    commencement cannot be reached, the Superintendent will fix the date and
    notify the Contractor in writing.

    notified in writing to the Contractor.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Possession of Site Under Traffic
</p>
<p>
    When work is to be undertaken on a road open to traffic, the Contractor
    will be given possession of all or part of the carriageway during such
    portions of the day as are specified in sub‑Clause 161.C5(b). The remainder
    of the carriageway shall remain clear of obstruction to traffic.
</p>
<p>
    Where a width of possession is shown in sub‑Clause 161.C5(b) such width
    shall be measured between the traffic faces of barriers or between the
    pavement edge and the traffic face of any barriers placed.
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contractor is given possession of the full width of the
    carriageway, traffic may be diverted only between the hours indicated in
    sub‑Clause 161.C5(b) in accordance with the requirements of Section 166.
</p>
<p>
    161.C2 HIGH VISIBILITY JACKETS
</p>
<p>
    All personnel, including supervisors, surveyors, labourers and plant
    operators, shall wear high visibility clothing in accordance with the
    requirements of the Worksite Safety – Traffic Management Code of Practice
    at all times.
</p>
<p>
    161.C3 CONTRACTOR'S REPRESENTATIVES
</p>
<p>
    On commencement of work, the Contractor shall advise the Superintendent in
    writing of the names, addresses and telephone numbers of employees who can

    proposed changes of representatives, addresses or telephone numbers shall
    be notified promptly to the Superintendent and confirmed in writing to the
    Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    161.C4 SITE CLEANUP
</p>
<p>

    <strong>PART D - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    161.D1 ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for the preparation, implementation and
    other arrangements associated with the Environmental Management Plan (EMP).
</p>
<p>
    The EMP shall include, as a minimum, the following:
</p>
<p>
    (a) Environmental Aspects - an assessment of all environmental aspects that
    could be impacted on the environment, including but not limited to matters
    covered in this specification, including 161.D1(e), with reference to
    <em>
        EPA Publication 880 - Guideline for Environmental Management: Spraying
        Bituminous Materials
    </em>
    .
</p>
<p>
    (b) Legal and other requirements - details of approvals, licences and
    permits necessary to meet statutory requirements.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Resources, roles, responsibility and authority - details of staff
    involved in the approval, implementation and review of the EMP.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Competence, training and awareness - an induction and training plan to
    ensure that all site personnel (including subcontractors) understand the
    EMP and are aware how the EMP is to be implemented in relation to the
    works, including any possible emergency response procedures.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Operational Control - EMP shall document environmental procedures to
    manage all identified impacts and environmental protection requirements,
    including any permits. These procedures may include but are not limited to:
</p>
<p>
    • water quality and monitoring (including loss of bitumen or runoff during
    or after rain leading to water pollution, aggregate entering stormwater
    pits, kerb and channel);
</p>
<p>
    • air quality (including odour and other emissions from bitumen);
</p>
<p>
    • bitumen overspray and drift especially in marked areas of roadside
    significance;
</p>
<p>
    • materials and resource use (including use and care of stacksites,
    treatment of hazardous chemicals and petroleum spills);
</p>
<p>
    • preservation of habitat and parking vehicles or plant in roadway
    reserves;
</p>
<p>
    • waste management (including raised reflective pavement markers, petroleum
    wastes); and
</p>
<p>
    • weed management and plant hygiene.
</p>
<p>
    These procedures may include inspection and test plans and checklists. The
    location of environmental controls should be documented on a site plan. The
    procedures should consider the environmental risk, objectives, targets,
    control measures, maintenance (if appropriate), monitoring and measurement
    (if required) and contact information.
</p>
<p>
    (f) Emergency preparedness and response - an emergency response procedure
    shall include, but is not limited to, processes for managing any
    environmental emergency on-site, including spillage of bitumen and fuels
    and shall include responses such as contacting emergency services, relevant
    stakeholders and clean-up of the site. The Contractor shall also detail its
    program for training its staff in its ‘Emergency Preparedness and Response’

    <strong>PART E - PROGRAM AND PROGRESS</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    161.E1 REVIEW OF PROGRESS
</p>
<p>
    If at any time the Superintendent considers that the rate of progress is
    insufficient to ensure completion of the whole or any separable part of the
    Works by the relevant Date for Practical Completion, the Superintendent may
    direct the Contractor to submit within 7 days written details of the
    intended procedure for the execution of the remainder of the work under the
    Contract.
</p>
<p>
    161.E2 ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS
</p>
<p>
    Time lost due to adverse weather conditions is defined for the purpose of
    this Contract as time lost due to wet weather, fog, excessively hot,
    excessively cold and/or dangerously windy conditions and to the effects of
    these adverse weather conditions, e.g. wet site conditions following rain.
</p>
<p>
    The Contract period includes the following allowance for time lost due to
    adverse weather conditions:
</p>
<p>
    ##(insert number of working days where applicable and strikethrough
    inapplicable alternatives):
</p>
<p>
    *** Whole of Works - ##: ‘working’ days
</p>
<p>
    *** Separable part A - ##: ‘working’ days
</p>
<p>
    *** Separable part B - ##: ‘working’ days
</p>
<p>
    *** Separable part C - ##: ‘working’ days
</p>
<p>
    *** Separable part D - ##: ‘working’ days
</p>
<p>
    *** This allowance is based on an 8-hour working day, 5 day working week
    and ##:includes / does not include allowance for periods when works are
    suspended due to adverse weather. This allowance is for administrative
    purposes only and is not to be construed as the actual time lost due to
    adverse weather conditions likely to be encountered during the Contract.
    The Contractor is deemed to have made all necessary inquiries as to adverse
    weather in accordance with the General Conditions of Contract.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor's site representative shall notify the Superintendent
    immediately of any time lost due to adverse weather conditions and shall
    confirm such notification in writing within 7 days. This confirmation shall
    provide details of the nature and extent of delays and the construction
    activities affected. The Superintendent, if satisfied that the Contractor
    has taken reasonable steps to minimize the period of delay, will certify at
    the end of each month an appropriate period of time lost and will issue to
    the Contractor a monthly summary of certified time lost. The maximum period
    of time which will be certified on any working day will be 8 hours.
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contractor is required to provide a construction program, only
    delays affecting critical activities will be considered as time lost due to
    adverse weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
    If the total period of time certified exceeds the total allowance for the
    Whole of Works or applicable Separable Part of Works specified above, the
    Superintendent will, in accordance with the General Conditions of Contract,
    grant an extension of time for completion of the Whole of Works or
    applicable Separable Part of Works on the basis of 1 working day for each 8
    hours of certified time in excess of the allowance. No extension of time
    will be granted until the total excess period equals 8 hours or a multiple
    thereof. Periods of less than 8 hours duration shall accrue to form part of
    any subsequent extension of time.
</p>
<p>
    No additional costs arising from extensions of time granted due to excess
    adverse weather will be made.

    like nature arising out of or relating to the operations or
    responsibilities of the sub-contractor, take in relation to the
    Superintendent the like action to that which the Contractor is required to
    take under this clause.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    and preserve any evidence, such as notes or photographs;

</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall permit the Superintendent, staff of the VMIA, its

</p>
<p>
    161.H7 GENERAL
