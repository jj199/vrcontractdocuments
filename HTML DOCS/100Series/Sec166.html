    Road Safety Audits. Any agreed improvements shall be incorporated into the
    Contractor's current and / or future TMPs.
</p>
<p>
    (e) Worksite Traffic Management Speed Zones
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor must determine whether reduced speed limits are required at
    each worksite. The Code and Clause 166.07 provide guidance on this matter.
    Where it is proposed to alter the posted regulated speed limit to undertake
    the works, the Contractor shall prepare a Memorandum of Authorisation and
    submit it with the corresponding TMP for approval by VicRoads - no works
    shall be undertaken until such written approval is given.
</p>
<p>
    For long term works, the requirements of Section 4.3: Maintaining a Safe
    Workplace and Table 4.2: Guide to the Selection of Speed Limit at Roadworks
    of AS 1742.3&#8209;2009 shall be adopted.
</p>
<p>
    When workers are not present at the worksite, the worksite speed limit
    signs shall be removed or covered up so that the prevailing speed limit is
    reinstated. Alternatively, the appropriate worksite speed limit signs shall
    be displayed if deemed necessary for traffic safety purposes as provided in
    Section 4.3: Maintaining a Safe Workplace or Table 4.2: Guide to the
    Selection of Speed Limit at Roadworks of AS 1742.3&#8209;2009.
</p>
<p>
    Where the worksite speed limit determined from the Guide to the Selection
    of Speed Limits at Roadworks, is higher than the prevailing speed limit on
    the road, the prevailing speed limit shall remain. The worksite speed limit
    shall never be higher than the prevailing speed limit on the road.
</p>
<p>
    Clearance to worksite is measured to the edge of the nearest running
    traffic lane.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (f) Temporary Pavement Marking
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall delineate all temporary traffic arrangements with
    clear and unambiguous pavement marking at all times throughout the Works.
    The Contractor shall ensure that all line marking is consistent with the
    VicRoads Traffic Engineering Manual Volume 2 and is clearly visible at all
    times and under all conditions. The Contractor shall also ensure that
    obsolete line marking is adequately removed/covered to not be visible or
    cause confusion to drivers, and shall use means other than painting.
</p>
<p>
    Temporary line marking shall not be applied to the final wearing course of
    any new or existing pavement.
</p>
<p>
    (g) Provision for Pedestrians
</p>
<p>
    All pre-existing pedestrian movements through the worksite are to be
    maintained at all times.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that the Works do not compromise pedestrian
    movements in terms of safety or inconvenience. The Contractor shall provide
    and maintain temporary pathways as necessary to achieve these requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Pedestrian movements adjacent to the Works shall be physically separated
    from the worksite at all times throughout the Contract by parawebbing, or
    to the requirements of WorkSafe, whichever is the more stringent
    requirement.
</p>
<p>
    (h) Avoiding End-of-Queue Collisions
</p>
<p>
    At an active traffic control position, under conditions of heavy traffic or
    lengthy delays, or a combination of the two, long queues may form.
    Depending on speed of traffic and sight distance to the end of a queue,
    additional advance warning may be required to avoid
    end&#8209;of&#8209;queue collisions.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide end&#8209;of&#8209;queue protection in
    accordance with the requirements of AS 1742.3&#8209;2009.

    166.18 VERTICAL CLEARANCE FOR BRIDGEWORKS OVER ROADWAYS
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    <strong>***</strong>
    The Contractor shall provide a minimum vertical clearance for all
    structures over roadways in accordance with Part 2 of the VicRoads Road
    Design Guidelines. Notwithstanding the above, a temporary minimum clearance
    of ##(check minimum height requirements):4.5 metres may be provided over
    roads during construction subject to the approval of the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    Where the vertical clearance during construction is less than the specified
    design clearance in the VicRoads Roads Design Guidelines and approved by
    the Superintendent, the Contractor shall design, supply, erect and maintain
    temporary low clearance warning gauges in advance of the bridgeworks. The
    location, type and details of all low clearance warning gauges shall comply
    with the requirements of AS 1742.3 and this specification taking into
    account the safety of bridge workers and other traffic, traffic volume and
    types of vehicles using the road, and suitable detours for high vehicles.
    In addition, the Contractor shall provide bridge clearance signs in
    accordance with AS 1742.3.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Protection Level
</p>
<p>
    The following defines the various protection levels that will apply to each
    specific structure as specified in Table 166.181.
</p>
<p>
    (i) Protection Level 1
</p>
<p>
    Three low clearance warning gauges shall be erected in advance of
    bridgeworks. The first low clearance warning gauge approached by traffic
    shall be an electronic infra&#8209;red warning system (or similar) linked
    to flashing lights, flashing message signs and an audible alarm which is
    activated when the over dimensional vehicle exceeds the available
    clearance. The second low clearance warning gauge shall be a
    non&#8209;rigid physical barrier designed to impact with over dimensional
    vehicles but not restrain the passage of the vehicle. The third low
    clearance warning gauge shall be a semi&#8209;rigid physical barrier
    designed to impact more severely and partially restrain over dimensional
    vehicles. Low clearance warning gauges shall be designed to withstand the
    anticipated impact loads and not endanger the travelling public as a result
    of impact.
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Protection Level 2
</p>
<p>
    Two low clearance warning gauges shall be erected in advance of
    bridgeworks. The first gauge approached by traffic shall be a
    non&#8209;rigid physical barrier designed to impact with over dimensional
    vehicles but not restrain the passage of the vehicle. The second low
    clearance warning gauge shall be a semi&#8209;rigid physical barrier
    designed to impact more severely and partially restrain over dimensional
    vehicles. Low clearance warning gauges shall be designed to withstand the
    anticipated impact loads and not endanger the travelling public as a result
    of impact.
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Protection Level 3
</p>
<p>
    One low clearance warning gauge shall be erected in advance of bridgeworks.
    This low clearance warning gauge shall be a non&#8209;rigid physical
    barrier designed to impact with over dimensional vehicles but not restrain
    the passage of the vehicle. Low clearance warning gauges shall be designed
    to withstand the anticipated impact loads and not endanger the travelling
    public as a result of impact.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (c) Warning Gauges
</p>
<p>
    The location of low clearance warning gauges shall be in accordance with
    the requirements of AS 1742.3 and also take account of traffic speeds and
    the geometric constraints of the site.
</p>
<p>
    All low clearance warning gauge installations shall include protection of
    the columns by means of safety barriers complying with the Code. Safety
    barriers shall incorporate an approach taper of 10 to 1 commencing outside
    the clear zone for the road.
</p>
<p>
    Means of regulated access for high vehicles beyond the low clearance
    warning gauges shall be provided if practicable and required by local
    traffic.
</p>
<p>
    Vertical clearance below low clearance warning gauges shall be 0.1 metres
    less than the clearance below the structure.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Details of the low clearance warning gauge proposal shall be
        submitted to the Superintendent for review at least 2 weeks, or the
        period specified herein, prior to the commencement of installation.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall remove low clearance warning gauges and bridge
    clearance signs at the earliest possible time after the completion of the
    works. The Contractor shall arrange and provide traffic management during
    erection and removal of the low clearance warning gauges.
