    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for in situ stabilisation of existing
    pavements by the addition of foamed bitumen and other supplementary
    binders. The requirements relate to mix design, preparation of existing
    pavement materials, supply of bitumen and supplementary binders,
    construction plant, and spreading, mixing, and compaction of pavement
    layers.
    <p>

    308.02 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Available Lime</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The amount of Calcium Oxide (CaO) or Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) contained
    in Quicklime or Hydrated Lime respectively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Available Lime Index (ALI)
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Calcium Oxide or Calcium Hydroxide content of quicklime or hydrated
    lime respectively, expressed as a percentage of the total mass of lime
    determined in accordance with AS 4489.6.1.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Expansion Ratio
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The expansion ratio is the ratio of the maximum volume of the bitumen in
    its foamed state to the final volume of bitumen once the foaming has
    subsided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Foamed Bitumen
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Foamed bitumen is a mixture of air, water and hot bitumen. When hot bitumen
    comes in contact with cold water the mixture expands to greater than ten
    times its original bitumen volume forming a fine mist or foam.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Half-life
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Half-life is the time taken (measured in seconds) for the maximum volume of
    foamed bitumen to dissipate to half of the maximum expansion volume.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hydrated Lime</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Hydrated lime is a powdered form of lime consisting primarily of calcium
    hydroxide, also referred to as slaked lime.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Quicklime</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Quicklime is a fine granulated powder consisting primarily of Calcium Oxide
    that can be readily slaked by the application of water after it has been
    evenly spread to form Calcium Hydroxide.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Initial Working Time
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The time required to mix, fully compact and trim the stabilised pavement
    layer after the addition of foamed bituminous binder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Reference Density
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The reference density is the maximum dry density or the peak converted wet
    density determined in accordance with the appropriate test method, but
    adjusted for oversize material as appropriate.
    <p>

<p>
    <strong>
        Supplementary Binder
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Foamed bitumen stabilisation may incorporate a supplementary binder
    comprising either hydrated lime or quicklime.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Target Depth
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The target depth is the cutting depth required by the reclaimer/stabiliser
    to achieve the lower reference level (LRL). To achieve the LRL, the cutting
    depth (target depth) should take into account the bulk height. Refer to
    Figure 1 Diagramatic Representation of Foam Bitumen Stabilisation's key
    terms. In establishing the target depth the following should be noted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Pulverisation/secondary additive incorporation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Preliminary pulverisation and incorporation of supplementary binder is
    mixing to 50 mm less than the design depth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Bulking after secondary additive incorporation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After surface compaction and trimming, the volume of materials change due
    to incorporation of the supplementary binder. The bulking height above the
    finished surface level (FSL) needs to be identified and added to the design
    depth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Target depth/final foam bitumen stabilisation pass
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The cutting depth required on the final pass by the reclaimer/stabiliser to
    reach the LRL will need to account for the additional bulking above the
    FSL.

    308.05 PAVEMENT MATERIALS INVESTIGATION AND MIX DESIGN
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless specified in Clause 308.16(c) and (d), the Contractor shall produce
    a mix design for the in situ stabilised pavement material in accordance
    with Austroads Guide to Pavement Technology Part 4D : Stabilised Materials.
    The in situ stabilised pavement material is required to meet the specified
    grading, plasticity and strength requirements, and contain a bituminous
    binder which will allow sufficient working time to mix, place, compact and
    trim the material before the initial set takes place. The mix design
    procedure shall ensure that the bituminous stabilised material is a
    flexible cohesive pavement material capable of withstanding ravelling under
    traffic prior to sealing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The design is to provide a modified material with the following properties:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Initial modulus &gt; 700 MPa;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Three day cured modulus &gt;2500 to 4000 MPa;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Three day soaked modulus &gt;1500 to 2000 MPa; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Retained modulus &gt; 0.5 (ratio wet modulus to dry modulus), a foam
    bitumen stabilised pavement that does not lose greater than 50% of strength
    when inundated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Grading
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The final grading limits for the material to be stabilised after addition
    of any granular additive, if required to correct the grading shall be in
    accordance with Table 308.051.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide and operate sufficient spreading, mixing,
    watering and compaction plant to complete the work in accordance with the
    requirements of this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    (b) Spreader for Supplementary Binder
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Mechanical equipment specifically designed for the spreading of
    supplementary binder directly on to the prepared roadbed shall be used. The
    spreader shall be fitted with calibrated load cells and be capable of
    accurately regulating the discharge of the supplementary binder at various
    widths such that the requirements of Clause 308.14 are met. When hydrated
    lime is used as a supplementary binder it is preferable to use a reclaimer
    with an integrated spreader to minimise binder loss due to wind.

    The pulverisation and mixing of pavement material together with water and
    bituminous binder shall be carried out using a purpose designed machine for
    bituminous stabilisation of road pavements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The stabilisation machine shall satisfy the following requirements:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) a minimum engine power capacity of 315 kW to ensure adequate mixing of
    materials
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) a computer controlled bitumen flow meter to determine binder
    application rate for process control
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) a bitumen injection system linked to the ground speed to ensure an
    accurate application throughout runs, irrespective of the speed of the
    equipment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) each jet on the bitumen injection bar shall have separate on and off
    controls to maintain uniform transverse control in the overlapping runs

<p>
    (c) Preparation of the Existing Pavement, Primary Pulverisation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    One (1) pass of a reclaimer/stabiliser or profiler shall be used to
    pulverise the material to be stabilised to a depth that is 50 mm less than
    the target depth of the stabilised layer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Preliminary pulverisation shall occur:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) after the removal and replacement of material identified as material
    not suitable for stabilisation;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) prior to the addition of shape correction material, and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) prior to the application or addition of either bituminous or
    supplementary binders.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall remove or pulverise lumps of asphalt or seal which
    would otherwise be retained on a 53 mm sieve. The volume of any large size
    material removed from the site shall be replaced with an equivalent volume
    of suitable granular material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the existing pavement material is not suitable for stabilisation,
    granular material that complies with the requirements of Standard Section
    812 Crushed Rock for Pavement Base and Subbase shall be used to replace
    this material prior to stabilisation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    *** The Contractor shall be responsible for the procurement of sufficient
    specified material to complete the work. The Contractor shall supply
    details demonstrating compliance of the materials meeting Class 1, Class 2
    or Class 3. ##(strikethrough whichever is not relevant):
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Spreading of Supplementary Binder
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Spreading of the supplementary binder shall be carried out in accordance
    with the mix design rate or as specified in Clause 308.16(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If quicklime is used it shall be slaked with sufficient water to allow
    complete hydration such that the material remains friable after slaking.
    Water shall be applied by spraying over the quicklime spread over the road
    surface.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Foaming of Bitumen
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At the start of each stabilisation operation the Contractor shall confirm
    that all bitumen foaming nozzles are operating by conducting a foaming test
    adjacent to the site. The foamed bitumen from the test shall not be
    incorporated in the pavement material and the Contractor is responsible for
    the management of this waste. At the start of each tanker load of bitumen,
    the half-life and expansion ratio of the foamed bitumen shall be determined
    and reported.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) Initial Mixing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Initial mixing shall commence as soon as practical after spreading of the
    supplementary binder. The supplementary binder shall be incorporated into
    the pavement materials to 50 mm less than the specified pavement depth.
    Water may be added during the mixing process to meet the target moisture
    content envelope which is required for compaction following the mixing of
    the foamed bitumen.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Incorporation of the supplementary binder shall be achieved using a
    reclaimer/stabiliser before the foamed bitumen is added to the pavement
    material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where indicated by visual inspection that the resultant mix is not uniform
    and/or the moisture distribution throughout the layer is variable, the
    Contractor shall carry out additional passes with the mixing equipment to
    improve the uniformity of the:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) material
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) distribution of the supplementary binder
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) distribution of the added moisture.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The mixed material is to be lightly compacted prior to the addition of the
    foamed bitumen.

</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (g) Foam Bitumen Mixing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The incorporation of the bitumen is to be carried out to the specified
    thickness in one or more mixing passes. Foam bitumen stabilisation should
    not proceed if the bitumen temperature does not comply with the specified
    bitumen temperature included in the test certificate required in Clause
    308.04(a).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where indicated by visual inspection that the foamed bitumen is not
    uniformly mixed and/or the moisture distribution throughout the layer is
    variable, the Contractor shall carry out additional passes with the mixing
    equipment to improve the uniformity of the:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) material being stabilised; and/or
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) distribution of the bitumen; and/or
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) distribution of moisture.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Mixing shall cease if bitumen streaks, blotches or bitumen rich masses form
    in the mixed material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The relative moisture ratio (RMR) prior to incorporation of the foamed
    bitumen shall be not less than 55% or greater than 75% of optimum moisture
    content (OMC) of the material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (h) Compaction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Compaction of the stabilised layer shall commence immediately after mixing
    of foam bitumen. Compaction equipment shall work as close as practicable
    behind the mixer to maximise the time available for compaction. Compaction
    and trimming shall be carried out in a continuous operation until
    completed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Trimming
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The material trimmed off shall be cut to waste and, if necessary, removed
    from site.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On completion of trimming and final rolling compaction equipment marks
    shall be removed if a sprayed sealed surfacing is to be applied to the
    foamed bitumen stabilised layer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    308.09 JOINTING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Longitudinal joints shall be avoided by completing a full carriageway width
    each day. If a longitudinal joint is required, because of rain or traffic
    control requirements, it shall be located at a lane line or in the centre
    of the carriageway. Transverse joints shall be formed where stabilisation
    operations have been halted and at the end of each day's work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Joints shall be formed by cutting back into the fully compacted previously
    stabilised material by a minimum of 100 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The level and shape of the surface at all joints shall be within the limits
    specified in Clause 308.03 except when a sprayed sealed surfacing is to be
    applied to the stabilised layer where a 5 mm maximum tolerance shall be
    adopted.
    <p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    308.10 TEST ROLLING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stabilised layers shall pass test rolling in accordance with Section 173,
    prior to acceptance of the layer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any unstable areas detected by test rolling shall be rectified.

    308.11 MAINTENANCE OF THE STABILISED SURFACE PRIOR TO SURFACING OR OVERLAY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water curing shall commence immediately after the completion of compaction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall keep the stabilised pavement surface moist and
    protected from damage by traffic or construction activities until either a
    further pavement layer or the bituminous surfacing is applied. Where the
    pavement is opened to traffic within 3 hours of compaction being completed
the initial modulus measured after 3 hours of air drying at 25&#176;C (    <u>+</u> 5&#176;C) shall be a minimum of 700 MPa.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall maintain drainage of all stabilised areas throughout
    the period of construction to ensure run&#8209;off of rainfall without
    ponding.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Lot Testing Requirements
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a Scale A or Scale B compaction standard is specified in Table
    308.16, compaction is to be accepted by density testing in lots of similar
    material and work. The maximum lot size shall be the area of work completed
    on the same day up to 4,000 m<sup>2</sup> provided that the whole of the
    lot is essentially a uniform material similar to material used for the
    relevant mix design applicable to the lot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the material is too variable to be able to assign a single maximum dry
    density for the lot, a separate reference density shall be determined for
    each test site.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If a compaction scale is not specified in Table 308.16, the Scale C
    compaction procedure shall be adopted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The calculation of density ratio shall be based on Modified compactive
    effort of the laboratory prepared sample containing the design rate of
    bituminous and supplementary binder.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The work shall be assessed for compliance with Scale A, Scale B or Scale C
    requirements for testing and acceptance of compaction as specified in
    Clauses 308.13(b), (c) and (d) and Clause 308.16.
    <p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Determination of the Density Ratio
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Field density shall be measured at the completion of compaction of the
    foamed bitumen stabilised pavement. Material shall be sampled from the site
    to enable three samples to be prepared in the laboratory, for determination
    of the reference density, before three hours have elapsed after foam
    bitumen stabilisation. The Density Ratio shall be determined in accordance
    with Section 173.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Scale A Requirements for Testing and Acceptance of Compaction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If a single maximum dry density can be assigned to the lot the work
    represented by the lot will be accepted as far as compaction is concerned
    if the characteristic value of density ratio obtained from six randomly
    selected test sites within the lot is not less than 98%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the characteristic value of density ratio of the lot is less than 98%,
    but greater than or equal to 93% the work represented by the lot may be
    accepted as far as compaction is concerned but payment for the whole of
    such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>P = 6R</strong>
    <strong><sub>c</sub></strong>
    <strong>
        - 488
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    in which Rc is the characteristic value of density ratio of the lot and P
    is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of work
    represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed 100.
    For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented by
    the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause
    308.16(b).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Work which has a mean value of density ratio of less than 93% shall be
    rejected and the Contractor shall submit a proposal to rectify the work to
    the Superintendent for approval.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Scale B Requirements for Testing and Acceptance of Compaction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The work represented by the lot will be accepted as far as compaction is
    concerned if the mean of the individual density ratio test values from
    three randomly selected test sites for the lot is not less than 100%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the mean of the individual density ratio test values for the lot is less
    than 100% but greater than or equal to 95%, the work represented by the lot
    may be accepted as far as compaction is concerned but payment for the whole
    of such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> P = 6R</strong>
    <strong><sub>m</sub></strong>
    <strong>
        - 500
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    where Rm is the mean of the individual density ratio test values for the
    lot and P is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of
    work represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed
    100. For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented
    by the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause
    308.16(b).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Scale C Requirements for Acceptance of Compaction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may direct the Contractor to construct a trial section
    of stabilised pavement as specified in Clause 308.12.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of work will be based on compaction plant to be used, compaction
    routine and a density monitoring procedure using a nuclear gauge and proof
    rolling as specified or approved by the Superintendent.
    <p>

    308.14 REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE OF BINDER CONTENT
    <em>
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Mat or Tray System for Supplementary Binder
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The average spreading rate of the supplementary binder shall be ascertained
    by dividing the mass of binder spreading by the area over which the binder
    has been spread. Where the average spreading rate is less than 95% of the
    specified or design spread rate, additional binder shall be spread to bring
    the average rate up to at least the design spread rate. Lots where the
    binder is spread at an average rate less than 95% design spread rate will
    be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall check the uniformity of the spreading of the
    supplementary binder at the frequency specified in Clause 308.15 by placing
    mats or trays with a plan area not less than 1 m2 in the path of the
    spreading vehicle and dividing the mass of the supplementary binder
    deposited on each mat by the plan area of the mat or tray. Where the spread
    rate so determined for any mat or tray is less than the specified rate by
    more than 10%, additional supplementary binder shall be spread over the
    part or all of the area over which the binder has been spread.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Continuous Weighing System
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The mass of the supplementary binder spread over the pavement surface may
    be measured and recorded by a spreader fitted with a fully calibrated
    electronic weigh scale system capable of continuously measuring and
    recording the mass of the supplementary binder at intervals of not more
    than 100 m of forward travel. The recorded measurements of spread rate
    shall be made available to the Superintendent on request.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Bituminous Binder Application
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The binder shall be uniformly incorporated by a controlled device that
    provides calibration to the application rate in litres/m2 of residual
    bitumen. The rate of application shall be such as to provide the specified
    binder content in the compacted material. In addition, for foamed bitumen
    the minimum expansion ratio shall be 10 and the minimum half-life shall be
    20 seconds.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Mixing uniformity shall be continuously inspected by the Contractor and
    work shall stop when bitumen streaks or blotches are observed.

    308.15 MINIMUM TESTING FREQUENCY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall test the materials and the stabilised pavement layer
    at a frequency which is sufficient to ensure that the materials and work
    under the Contract comply with the specified requirements but which is not
    less than that shown in Table 308.151.
