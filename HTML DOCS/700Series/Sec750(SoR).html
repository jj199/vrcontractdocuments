    <p>
        Further to the requirements in Clause 166.02 all Routine Maintenance
        works shall be undertaken in accordance with the Code of Practice for
        Worksite Safety - Traffic Management (RMA 2004 or the most recent
        version), and shall be defined as either:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) On-Road / Pavement works - shall be assessed as Mobile Works, Very
        Short Term Works, Short Term Works or Long Term Works, whichever is the
        most appropriate. Mobile inspections shall be assessed as Very Short
        Term Works.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Off-Road / Roadside works (including shoulder grading and grass
        mowing) that are undertaken from the pavement - shall be assessed as

        Off-Road / Roadside works that are undertaken from the roadside can be
        undertaken as Very Short Term Works. Activities that may need some
        encroachment into the roadway that can be undertaken safely during gaps
        in traffic (e.g. a grass mower manoeuvring around an obstacle whilst
        mowing the roadside or median) shall be subject to a risk assessment.
        The minimum roadworks signing shall be in accordance with Figure 3 of
        the Code of Practice for Worksite Safety - Traffic Management (RMA
        2004).

    <p>
        (a) Initial Condition Survey
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of the Initial Condition Survey is to confirm, measure and
        record those standard jobs that meet or exceed the Intervention
        Criteria and require rectification, and thus provide a record of the
        condition of the road network at commencement of the Contract.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Initial Defect Inspection undertaken and as described in Clause
        750.B04 and the Initial Night Hazard Inspection undertaken and as
        described in Clause 750.B02, shall become the Initial Condition Survey
        for the Contract. This Initial Condition Survey shall be completed
        within the first month after the Contractor is given possession of the
        site and shall be a joint inspection involving representatives of the
        Contractor and the Superintendent, unless otherwise directed by the
        Superintendent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where as a result of the Initial Condition Survey, a normal routine
        standard job, apart from those items listed in Table 750.I021, is found
        to meet or exceed the specified intervention criteria, the Contractor
        shall repair or rectify the Defect within the specified response time
        or within the time period agreed with the Superintendent at the joint
        programming meeting. Payment for bringing Defects identified in the
        Initial Condition Survey back to the required standard shall be in
        accordance with the appropriate payment method specified in Table
        750.H011 unless directed otherwise by the Superintendent.

    </p>
    <p>
        The Defect Inspection as described in Clause 750.B04, undertaken 2
        months prior to the Date of Practical Completion shall become the
        Contract Completion Condition Survey and shall be a joint inspection
        involving representatives of the Contractor and the Superintendent.
        Hazard and Defect Inspections are still required after the Contract
        Completion Condition Survey.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where standard jobs are identified as meeting or exceeding the
        specified Intervention Criteria the Superintendent may:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) direct the Contractor to repair or rectify the Defects within a
        period to be determined by the Superintendent; or
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) arrange for the rectification of those Defects by others and in
        this event a deduction will be made to the Contract Sum for the full
        cost of such works.

        The Superintendent may require the Contractor to respond to Hazard
        Issues that have been brought to the attention of the Superintendent.
        The Contractor shall respond within the response time shown in Table

        750.B03 MONTHLY WORKS PROGRAM AND JOINT PROGRAMMING MEETINGS
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) To assist in the programming of maintenance works, and further to
        Clause 163.D1, the Contractor shall develop and maintain two Work
        Programs in a format acceptable to the Superintendent as follows:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) A 12 month Maintenance Program that identifies the Routine
        Maintenance, Programmed Maintenance, expected major maintenance works
        and Defect repair works arising from inspections for all roads within
        the Contract. The Contractor shall review and update the Maintenance
        Program on a 3 monthly basis and submit an updated Maintenance Program
        every 3 months illustrating the proposed maintenance works for the
        forthcoming 12 month period; and
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) A 3 month Look-ahead Program that identifies the Programmed
        Maintenance and agreed maintenance works that are programmed for
        completion on all roads within the upcoming 3 month period. The program
        shall identify those maintenance jobs which meet or exceed the
        Intervention Criteria and are yet to be repaired or remedied. The
        Contractor shall include a plant, labour and material schedule that
        illustrates the expected resources necessary to complete the programmed
        maintenance activities. The Contractor shall review and update the
        Look-ahead Program each month.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Five business days prior to each monthly Site Meeting, the Contractor
        shall status the works achieved for the previous month against the
        proposed work for that month in the previous Look-ahead program and
        report on the percentage of programmed works that were satisfactorily
        completed. The report of completed works shall be used by the
        Contractor in developing the revised 3 month Look-ahead program for the
        next 3 month period.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment for the review and development of revised Works Programs shall
        be paid under the relevant Schedule Item in Schedule 1 subject to the
        Contractor complying with the requirements of this clause to the
        Superintendent's satisfaction.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where the Contractor fails to develop the required Works Program, the
        Superintendent reserves the right to develop such Works Program at the
        Contractor's cost.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Joint Programming Meetings may be held in conjunction with the
        monthly Site Meeting. The purpose of the Joint Programming Meeting
        shall be to:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) review the works completed in the previous month;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) review current Defect Inspection reports;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) identify works to be completed in the coming month under the
        Provisional Sum items and Provisional Quantity items;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) agree on the most efficient timing for completion of the scheduled
        works on a needs-basis and a geographical basis where possible; and
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (v) review resources availability.

        750.B04 DEFECT INSPECTIONS
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Defect Inspections shall involve the Contractor driving the entire road
        network maintained by the Contractor and recording Defects to the
        public, including all of the Defects meeting the Intervention Criteria
        described in Table 750.H011. Defect Inspections of the entire road
        network maintained by the Contractor shall be undertaken monthly, for
        the duration of the Contract,<strong> </strong>in accordance with AS
        1742.3 as follows. For these monthly Defect Inspections, the
        Superintendent will inspect at least 10 per cent of the road network
        each month and the Contractor shall inspect the remainder of the road
        network in the same manner. The Superintendent will inspect different
        sections of the road network on each successive monthly inspection to
        ensure the Superintendent progressively inspects the whole of the road
        network. The Superintendent will provide the recorded Defect Inspection
        data to the Contractor for inclusion in the Contractor's Monthly Works
        Program.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <br clear="all"/>
    <p>
        Hazard Inspections pursuant to Clause 750.B02 may be conducted at the
        same time as Defect Inspections.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            HP Prior to commencing Defect Inspections, the Contractor shall
            submit to the Superintendent for review, a works method statement
            detailing how the Defect Inspections are to be conducted.
        </strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Data from Defect Inspections collected by the Contractor and the
        Superintendent shall be compared (in the context that equivalent
        sections are inspected by the Superintendent and the Contractor, 1
        month apart) and collated, and the Contractor shall provide a record of
        Defect Responses to the Superintendent at a frequency not exceeding 1
        month. It shall be in electronic format using the standard ASCII
        character set, or some other form agreed by the Superintendent. Each
        data record shall be formatted in a single line with data items
        separated by commas and all text enclosed in double quotation marks.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor is required to achieve in the Contractor's monthly
        Hazard and Defect listings, at least 85 per cent compliance with the
        quantity of those listed by the Superintendent. Although in monthly
        inspections, the Superintendent will inspect road sections different
        from those inspected by the Contractor, if after 3 consecutive monthly
        inspections it is apparent that the Contractor may not be identifying
        or recording Hazard and Defect to a similar degree as the
        Superintendent, then the Superintendent may conduct a joint inspection
        of at least 10 per cent of the network inspected by the Contractor, to
        establish and remedy the disparity between the Contractor's Hazard and
        Defect Inspections and the 85 per cent compliance requirement.

    <p>
        (a) Initial Response
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor's Initial Emergency Response Unit shall, within the
        capability of the unit, make the incident site safe for the public or
        otherwise assist the control agency. This may involve the setting up
        and operation of detour routes for the duration of the incident.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any response which exceeds the capability of the Initial Emergency
        Response Unit is to be immediately notified to the Superintendent or
        the VicRoads TMC. The Superintendent may direct that additional
        Contractor resources be provided as Provisional Works or arrange for
        the work to be carried out by others.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall co-operate with the control agency and other
        emergency services. Any request to carry out work outside the road
        reserve shall be referred to the Superintendent for approval prior to
        the work being undertaken.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor is not responsible for salvaging vehicles which have
        been damaged in crashes and is not required to assist the owners of
        such vehicles except where necessary for the safety of the public or to
        reduce delays to traffic.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst the Contractor has a role in routine emergency incidents to
        provide manpower, equipment and materials to clear and/or make roads
        safe, the Contractor's role does not extend to cleaning up sites after
        crashes, unless directed to do so by the Superintendent.

        (b) Notification to VicRoads TMC
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall notify the VicRoads TMC as soon as practicable of
        all requests for assistance from the Victoria Police or other control
        agency.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall notify the VicRoads TMC when the traffic on any
        section is likely to be delayed even for a short time by an incident.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Situation reports shall be made to the VicRoads TMC for the duration of
        the emergency at not more than hourly intervals.

    </p>
    <p>
        Any vehicle that is left on an arterial road or freeway for a period
        greater than 48 hours is deemed to be abandoned. With the approval of
        the Superintendent the Contractor may shift a vehicle which the
        Contractor has reasonable cause to believe has been abandoned and is a
        hazard to road users. The Contractor shall take care not to damage
        vehicles when moving them and arrange for Victoria Police to access
        locked vehicles.
        <p>
        </p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
    The description and extent of existing standard jobs meeting or exceeding
    Intervention Criteria (i.e, standard job defects) and which are permitted
    to remain as such is detailed in Table 750.I021. The Contractor shall be
    responsible for repairing or rectifying all defects excess of the nominated
    quantity of unit of work for each nominated standard job.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may direct that the permitted quantity be reduced as a
    result of existing standard job defects being repaired or rectified,
    either:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) through work carried out under the Contract under a Provisional
    Quantity Item, as a variation or as Dayworks;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    or
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) as a result of work undertaken by another party.
