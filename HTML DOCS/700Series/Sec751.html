    <p>
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        Currently there are three cabling methods used to connect the Help
        Phone to VicRoads TMC as follows:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) an exchange line from the communications provider;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) a connection via VicRoads cable running along the carriageway to a
        VicRoads sub-centre/PABX;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) an exchange line from the communications provider to a VicRoads
        termination pillar. Telstra provide an Easycall Delayed Hot Line for
        direct connection. In this case the dialling sequence is programmed
        into the Telstra exchange and is initiated automatically when the
        handset is picked up.

        'Escalated' fault is an initial fault raised to an increased response
        level. The fault is assessed by the Superintendent and based on the
        severity of the consequence which may be a result of the fault.
        'Escalated' faults will be notified to the Contractor at any time on
        any day and the Contractor shall act on these in accordance with the
        Superintendent's direction.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Faults will be defined as 'Escalated', 'Major' or 'Other' based on the
        information available. The Contractor will not be entitled to
        additional costs for any of the following:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        &#8226; fault attendances escalated from 'Other' to 'Major';

    </p>
    <p>
        &#8226; any fault attendance being the result of no fault found for the
        initial call-out.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        'Critical' Faults are faults outside predefined rectification times and
        they will be notified to the Contractor at any time on any day and the
        Contractor shall act on these in accordance with the Superintendent's
        direction. 'Critical' faults are to be paid outside the lump sum with
        the exception of subsequent attendances for the same fault.

        Initial Attendance is two (2) hours. The Contractor shall attend site,
        make the site safe and commence fault rectification within the Initial
        Attendance of two (2) hours. The Contractor shall rectify faults and
        restore the asset/device to normal operation within the time specified
        for Rectification in Table 751.C1.

    </p>
    <p>
        Where it is not possible to rectify detector loop(s)/wireless sensors
        due to works by others (e.g. roadwork, tram maintenance etc.), the
        Contractor shall monitor the location, liaise and coordinate with the
        responsible party on site, and ensure rectification is implemented as
        soon as the works are sufficiently complete to allow such.
        <p>

        751.E01 ASSET CONDITION SURVEYS
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) Initial Condition Survey
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the completion of the first routine service of the Contract an
        Initial Condition Survey of the assets shall be carried out by the
        Contractor. Joint inspections with the Superintendent may be arranged
        for elements outside specified requirements.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The purpose of this Initial Condition Survey is to establish and record
        type, number and condition of the assets. Elements that are outside
        specified requirements may be permitted to remain in current condition
        unless otherwise directed or advised by the Superintendent. If the
        Contractor fails to complete the Initial Condition Survey within the
        allocated period, no extension of time is given in writing, and the
        Superintendent may decide on the condition of any asset feature under
        the contract and its ruling is deemed final.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Superintendent will provide a response to the Initial Condition
        Survey submission within 14 days of the receipt. The Superintendent's
        ruling on the condition of any asset feature element will be final.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Any faults that have not been identified as part of the Initial
        Condition Survey are to be rectified by the Contractor at its costs.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Asset Condition Survey
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Superintendent may require the Contractor at any given time to
        participate in an additional Asset Condition Survey to validate that
        maintenance works are being conducted in accordance with the
        requirements of the Contract. The Superintendent will provide at least
        48 hours notice in writing to the Contractor of the intention to
        conduct such a survey and its extent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Superintendent will provide a written response to the Asset
        Condition Survey to the Contractor within 14 days of receipt. The
        Superintendent's ruling on the condition of any asset feature element
        will be final.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (c) Contract Completion Condition Survey
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Not later than 21 days prior to the Date of Practical Completion of the
        Contract, the Contractor and Superintendent shall conduct a Contract
        Completion Condition Survey of the whole of the asset to record the
        current condition of the assets.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where asset feature elements are identified outside the specified
        requirements the Superintendent may:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) direct the Contractor to bring the deficient asset feature elements
        to within the specified requirements within a period to be determined
        by the Superintendent;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) arrange for the rectification of those features by others and in
        this event a deduction will be made to the Contract Sum for the full
        cost of such works.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Superintendent will provide a written response to the Contract
        Completion Condition Survey to the Contractor within 14 days of
        receipt. The Superintendent's ruling on the condition of any asset
        feature element will be final.

        The Work may be carried out using methods with less inherent safety
        than the minimum standards in Table 1, provided a risk assessment is
        undertaken by a suitably qualified person taking into account (but not
        limited to) the Considerations and Exception Conditions listed below.
        The risk assessment shall be retained by the Contractor in an auditable

        After receipt of connection request from the Superintendent and full
        job details:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        1. determine that the computer has been dimensioned for the requested
        slot and the required DZ installed;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2. test / repair<sup>(i)</sup><sup> </sup>/ install modem as necessary
        to facilitate line commissioning;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Establish status<sup>(ii)</sup> of line pair to ensure that the line
        has been jumpered correctly to specified slot (confirmation of this
        should be obtained via TMC);
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        4. ensure that the line pair and jumpering information is entered in
        the MDF record book;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        5. confirm correct line pair and modem operation and request the TMC
        complete a DZ test;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        6. record ALL line levels at both 'A' and 'B' ends on or within 48
        hours after notification of site controller commission;
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        7. forward ALL line details either by facsimile or post to the
        Superintendent for database entry on VicRoads-supplied proforma.

        The following test procedure can only be done from a SCATS terminal. To
        start a test, you need a Modem Monitor Card (MMC) or an RX/TX card
        capable of looping the signal back to the SCATS computer for comparison
        with the test pattern sent from the computer.

        12 seconds. Transmission rate is 300 baud continuous. When a test is in
        operation, the terminal cannot be used for anything else. There is no
        limit to the length of time a test can be conducted.

        that the JED microprocessor card is operating correctly. The test also
        indicates power on functions of the system and is a limited indication
        that the communication (comms) card is operating correctly.

        The TC&#8209;900DR is a UHF radio device and needs to be properly
        installed and commissioned in order to function reliably.

        The TC&#8209;900DR is a duplex device which means that it can transmit
        and receive simultaneously. It uses two separate frequencies which come
        in pairs: 929.xxxxx MHz and a low frequency 853.xxxxx MHz. The radios
        come in either (H)igh or (L)ow transmit versions. Examine the test
        label on the bottom of the TC&#8209;900DR to determine which version
        the unit is. The Base Station is a TC&#8209;900DR&#8209;H which means
        that all roadside units should be TC&#8209;900DR&#8209;L.

        Antennas are generally mounted to a vertical pole with vertical
        polarisation as per the licence requirement. That is, the many parallel
        elements on the Yagi antenna are to point in the vertical direction:
        the parallel bars should point towards the ground and the sky.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            <strong>
                IMPORTANT: You will note that one of the vertical elements is a
                loop. This loop has a small hole on one end. Ensure that the
                small drain hole on one end of the dipole is pointed towards
                the ground so that water will drain out of the antenna.

        Antennas should be mounted as high as practical and away from metal
        surfaces which can cause reflections. All connections must be sealed
        with SCOTCH 23 type (or similar) amalgamating tape (not silastic) to
        ensure they are waterproof.

        Prior to installing a site, VicRoads must configure their database to
        enable the remote roadside unit so that the unit will operate upon
        installation of the communications system.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.1 Check supply volts and apply power to data radio, check for power
        indication (Green LED is on).
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.2 Program the unit using the TC&#8209;DFM9IP programming software and
        programming lead.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The following steps should be followed:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (1) Start up the software on a laptop PC.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (2) Connect serial Port 1 of the PC to Port A of the data radio using
        the programming lead.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (3) Select the menu 'Program a modem from a disk file'.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (4) Apply power to the TC&#8209;900DR radio. You will now be confronted
        with a file menu from which to select.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (5) Select the file corresponding to the site you wish to program. You
        will now be presented with a program configuration page.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (6) Select 'Program Modem' located at the top centre of the screen. You
        will see a bar graph percentage screen depicting progress and a
        'programming complete' message when complete.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (7) You can now disconnect the programming lead from Port A and plug in
        the actual RS&#8209;232 cable connected the roadside unit.

        2.3 If you do not get any Transmitter indication when connected to
        roadside unit, you can test the transmitter by connecting the PTT plug
        (as detailed in the following drawing) connected to Port A of the Data
        Radio. <em> </em>The 'Tx' Red LED on the front panel of the
        TC&#8209;900DR should illuminate when this plug is installed to
        indicate RF transmission.

        2.4 Check and record for future reference RSSI (Received Signal
        Strength Indicator) level by connecting a multi&#8209;meter to Pin 5
        (&#8209;ve) and Pin 9 (+ve) of Port B connector and compare with
        predicted results using this graph. A sound link should give a reading
        of approximately 2.5 Volts or higher. Any signals levels lower than
        this should be reported to VicRoads.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.5 To obtain the maximum signal strength, align the antenna by
        pointing the antenna towards the Base Station Sites (located at the
        Police Academy in Mulgrave or 101 Collins Street in the city).
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: When the antenna has been re&#8209;aligned move away from the
        antenna before taking an RSSI level as readings will be effected if you
        are in front, behind or to the side of the antenna.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.6 If you have a 'throughline' power meter, check and record Forward
        and Reflected Power.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.7 If possible check and record TX frequency and deviation using
        suitable field test instrument.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        2.8 To ensure that the site is receiving the Base Station reliably and
        with data integrity, check for solid received signal indication
        ('RXSIG' Yellow LED) and for continuous ('SYNC' Yellow LED) indication.
        If both of these lights are on solid, then there is an extremely high
        probability that the link is working reliably (although by further
        antenna alignment, it could be improved).

        2.9 If the site is experiencing difficulties, the first step is to call
        Telstra National Operations Control Centre (NOCC) and request a site
        radio check which is possible from Telstra's Remote Diagnostics
        Monitoring capabilities which allows them to check each and every
        remote radio for Transmit Power, Received Signal Strength, Temperature,
        DC Volts and Frequency Error.

    <p>
        Systems will automatically begin charging the batteries during the day.
        Indication of system status is via five LEDs mounted on the control
        board of the control module. The LEDs indicate the following:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        LED 1 (GREEN): SYSTEM LED - system operation
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        LED 2 (ORANGE): CHARGE LED - Charge mode
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        LED 3 (YELLOW): LOAD LED - Load mode
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        LED 4 (RED): BATTERY LOW LED - Battery low mode
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        LED 5 (RED): POLARITY LED - Wrong polarity connection
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        1.1 Normal Operating Mode
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        At all times the SYSTEM LED will flash once per second. This indicates
        that the system clock and program are operating as per normal. The
        SYSTEM LED begins to flash approximately two seconds after power up. If
        the SYSTEM LED cannot be made to flash then further advice should be
        sought to make the system fully operational.
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        1.2 Battery Charging Mode
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        During daylight hours the system will enter its battery charging mode.
        This is indicated by the CHARGE LED being lit. It is normal for the
        CHARGE LED to turn on and off during the day as the battery is fully
        charged.
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
        1.3 Low Battery Warning
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Should the battery become low in charge after three to four weeks of
        extremely poor weather, the BATTERY LOW LED will flash and the system
        will shut down in order to preserve the battery system from further
        discharge. The battery and system should return to normal after
        receiving a few hours of direct sunlight, however if this is not the
        case swap the battery and return it to the workshop for full re-charge.
        If necessary carry out a series of 'deep cycle' re-charging.

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Periodical checks should be made of the photovoltaic glass surface and
        wiring connections. The glass surface should be clean of any spoiling
        to maintain optimum system performance.
        <p>

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The batteries are totally sealed and will not need electrolyte checks.
        The battery terminals should be periodically checked and clean of any
        corrosion. Should any corrosion be found on the terminals they may be
        coated with a sealing agent such as varnish, grease, petroleum jelly or
        a proprietary battery terminal spray after cleaning.

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The control system is maintenance free with no adjustments being
        possible. Regularly check to see that the equipment is in good
        connection with no apparent corrosion. Make sure the enclosure is
        resealed after inspection.

        3.1 Checking Battery Voltage
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Use a multimeter to check pins 2 and 4 of CN1, they are power supply
        inputs for the micro controller and load. The voltage should be above
        22 volts for normal operation. The LED 1 (System Indicator) is flashing
        at all times at a rate of once per second.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Check Pin 5 for the battery voltage sense. If there is no voltage
        reading on the multimeter then an open or broken cable is assumed and
        the LED 4 (Low Battery Indicator) will be flashing. The LED 4 is also
        flashing if the battery voltage is below 22 volts and it will turn off
        again if the battery system is charged up to 25 volts or above.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        3.2 Checking Panel Voltage
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Check Pins 1 (+ve) and 3 (-ve). During daylight hours, the voltage is
        changing from 20 volts to 42 volts maximum dependant on the sunlight
        intensity.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        If there is no voltage then inspect the panel cable for damage or open
        connection.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        3.3 Checking Power Output
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Check Pins 1 and 2 of the CN2 connector for the 12 volts output and
        Pins 3 and 4 for the 24 volts output. If the BATTERY LOW LED is
        flashing there will be no power output at these terminals.
