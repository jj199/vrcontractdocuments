        the Superintendent may:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) withhold from the monthly claim, the value of the uncompleted
        works, as assessed by the Superintendent; and/or
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) utilise other Contractors' resources to carry out these works with
        the actual cost of doing so (including VicRoads administration) being
        deducted from the Contractor's monthly payment; and/or
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) deduct an amount from the monthly claim equating to the
        non-compliance of not completing at least 95 per cent of the agreed
        monthly programmed works for standard Routine Maintenance works other
        than those requiring a response in accordance with Clause 752.B02, for
        example, if the Contractor completes only 80 per cent of the monthly
        programmed Routine Maintenance works, then a 20 per cent deduction to
        the Schedule Item for Routine Maintenance shall be applied; and/or
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) deduct an amount from the monthly claim equating to the
        non-compliance of not adequately completing Monthly Defect Inspections
        to achieve at least 85 per cent compliance with an audit compiled by a
        joint inspection conducted in accordance with Clause 752.B04, for
        example, if the Contractor identifies only 80 per cent of the quantity
        of Defects identified in any joint inspection of Defects, then a 20 per
        cent deduction to the Schedule Item for Defect Inspections shall be
        applied; and
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (v) where deductions have occurred on any 3 occasions within any 12
        month period, this may be considered to be a default in performance by
        the Contractor, to which the General Conditions of Contract may be
        applied.

        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Initial Defect Inspection undertaken and as described in Clause
        752.B04 shall become the Initial Condition Survey for the Contract.
        This Initial Condition Survey shall be completed within the first month
        after the Contractor is given possession of the site and shall be a
        joint inspection involving representatives of the Contractor and the

        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where standard jobs are identified as meeting or exceeding the
        specified Intervention Criteria the Superintendent may:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) direct the Contractor to repair or rectify the Defects within a
        period to be determined by the Superintendent; or
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>

        752.B03 MONTHLY WORKS PROGRAM AND JOINT PROGRAMMING MEETINGS
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (a) To assist in the programming of maintenance works, and further to
        Clause 163.D1, the Contractor shall develop and maintain two Work
        Programs in a format acceptable to the Superintendent as follows:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) a 12 month Maintenance Program that identifies the Routine and
        Programmed Maintenance works for all roads within the Contract. The
        Contractor shall review and update the Maintenance Program on a 3
        monthly basis and submit an updated Maintenance Program every 3 months
        illustrating the proposed maintenance works for the forthcoming 12
        month period; and
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) a 3 month Look-ahead Program that identifies the Programmed
        Maintenance and other agreed maintenance works that are programmed for
        completion on all roads within the upcoming 3-month period. The program
        shall identify those maintenance jobs which meet or exceed the
        Intervention Criteria and are yet to be repaired or remedied. The
        Contractor shall include a plant, labour and material schedule that
        illustrates the expected resources necessary to complete the programmed
        maintenance activities. The Contractor shall review and update the
        Look-ahead Program each month.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Superintendant may vary the frequency or scope of the Programmed
        Maintenance Works and if required to do so, shall advise the Contractor
        no later than 14 days prior to the programmed commencement to the
        Programmed Work.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <br clear="all"/>
    <p>
        Five business days prior to each monthly Site Meeting, the Contractor
        shall status the works achieved for the previous month against the
        proposed work for that month in the previous Look-ahead program and
        report on the percentage of programmed works that were satisfactorily
        completed. The report of completed works shall be used by the
        Contractor in developing the revised 3 month Look-ahead program for the
        next 3 month period.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where the Contractor fails to develop the required Works Program, the
        Superintendent reserves the right to develop such Works Program at the
        Contractor's cost.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (b) Joint Programming Meetings may be held in conjunction with the
        monthly Site Meeting. The purpose of the Joint Programming Meeting
        shall be to:
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (i) review the works completed in the previous month
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (ii) review current Defect Inspection reports
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iii) identify works to be completed in the coming month under the
        Provisional Sum items and Provisional Quantity items
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (iv) agree on the most efficient timing for completion of the scheduled
        works on a needs-basis and a geographical basis where possible
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        (v) review resources availability.

    </p>
    <p>
        Defect Inspections shall involve the Contractor driving the entire road
        network maintained by the Contractor and recording Defects, including
        all of the Defects meeting or exceeding the Intervention Criteria
        described in Table 752.H011. Defect Inspections of the entire road
        network maintained by the Contractor shall be undertaken monthly, for
        the duration of the Contract. For these monthly Defect Inspections, the
        Superintendent will inspect at least 10 per cent of the road network
        each month and the Contractor shall inspect the remainder of the road
        network in the same manner. The Superintendent will inspect different
        sections of the road network on each successive monthly inspection to
        ensure the Superintendent progressively inspects the whole of the road
        network. The Superintendent will provide the recorded Defect Inspection
        data to the Contractor for inclusion in the Contractor's Monthly Works
        Program.

            Prior to commencing Defect Inspections, the Contractor shall submit
            to the Superintendent for review, a works method statement
            detailing how the Defect Inspections are to be conducted.

        Data from Defect Inspections collected by the Contractor and the
        Superintendent shall be compared (in the context that equivalent
        sections are inspected by the Superintendent and the Contractor, one
        month apart) and collated, and the Contractor shall provide a record of
        Defect Responses to the Superintendent at a frequency not exceeding one
        month. It shall be in electronic format using the standard ASCII
        character set, or some other form agreed by the Superintendent. Each
        data record shall be formatted in a single line with data items
        separated by commas and all text enclosed in double quotation marks.

        The Contractor is required to achieve in the Contractor's monthly
        Defect listings, at least 85 per cent compliance with the quantity of
        those listed by the Superintendent. Although in monthly inspections,
        the Superintendent will inspect road sections different from those
        inspected by the Contractor, if after 3 consecutive monthly inspections
        it is apparent that the Contractor may not be identifying or recording
        Defect to a similar degree as the Superintendent, then the
        Superintendent may conduct a joint inspection of at least 10 per cent
        of the network inspected by the Contractor, to establish and remedy the
        disparity between the Contractor's Defect Inspections and the 85 per
        cent compliance requirement.

        Grass mowing and edge trimming to 3m behind the line of guideposts
        shall include the mowing and trimming of any grass on the shoulder, the
        removal of grass from the sealed pavement, and the removal of grass
        from around Culverts and Bridge Abutments. In Rural Areas, where there
        are no guideposts, mowing shall be to a width of 4.5 m from the edge of
        pavement. Grass mowing to a narrower width, will be acceptable, if
        there are fixed objects, such as trees, that prevent mowing to the
        required width with a reach mower, or there is identified native
        vegetation which is not to be mown.
        <p>
        </p>

        of open drains, sight lines from private driveways and access roads or
        reduces the sight distance to traffic signals, road safety or other
        signs is to be trimmed.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Vegetation seedlings shall not be allowed to develop within the road
        formation, at bridges and culvert sites or where there is the potential
        to interfere with road furniture, between table drain and pavement when
        table drain is within 6 m of shoulder/pavement and also including the
        area 3 m behind wire rope safety barriers, or 2 m behind guard fence.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Vegetation seedlings shall be removed from within clear zones, where
        the clear zone has been created as part of a specific road safety
        program or where vegetation has been planted as part of a new project
        and where clear zone guidelines have been implemented.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where trees from private property overhang the road reserve to such an
        extent that they affect road users, obscure signs or interfere with
        maintenance work, the Contractor shall advise the Superintendent prior
        to carrying out pruning work.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Where trees overhang from the road reserve into private property and a
        request from the land owner is made to remove them, the Contractor
        shall advise the Superintendent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall be responsible for the replacement of trees or
        shrubs which die or are damaged as a result of poor herbicide
        application or poor maintenance techniques including mowing or brush
        cutting. Replacement plants are to be supplied by the Contractor at the
        Contractor's expense and shall be in 15 cm pots and a minimum of height
        of 300 mm. Planting shall be carried out at the Contractors expense and
        shall include re-mulching/matting and watering to maintain healthy
        growth. No planting shall occur between the months of October and April

        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Contractor shall as part of Standard Job RM511, mow over weeds
        where present and practical to do so. Weed plants which are bearing
        hard seed capsules at the time of cutting are to be mown around. The
        Contractor may be requested to modify cutting where invasive weed
        species are present.

    </p>
    <p>
        Notwithstanding any other requirements stated in the Contract or stated
        by the manufacturer of the herbicides used, the Contractor shall not
        undertake herbicide spraying when prevailing weather conditions are
        likely to cause spray drift and/or vapour drift into adjacent
        properties and/or to cause harm to human life, stock or native
        vegetation and/or to cause runoff into adjacent waterways.

    <p>
        No herbicide spraying shall occur in any areas within the extent of
        works where the adjacent land use includes organically farmed products,
        vineyards or other similar activity where the type of herbicide needs
        to be carefully chosen, without the prior approval of the

        The Contractor shall collect and dispose of all litter within the road
        reserve, including litter in tree and shrub beds, according to the
        specified Intervention Criteria. The Contractor is required to collect
        litter immediately prior to mowing so that no litter is cut or spread
        during grass mowing activities. The Contractor shall dispose of the
        litter at a registered landfill site.
        <p>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment for the collection of litter in mown grass areas and
        plantations will form part of the grass cutting or plantation
        maintenance rate submitted for each road under the Contract. No
        separate payment will be made for the collection of litter in mown
        grassed areas and plantations when programmed work is undertaken.

        are received by either the Contractor or the Superintendant, that are
        not the result of the Contractor's failure to remove litter, the
        Contractor shall notify the Superintendent to seek approval to remove
        the litter as Provisional Works.

        Contractor shall obtain the name and address and vehicle registration
        number of any person observed placing or dumping litter on the reserve
        and report these to the Superintendent. That person should be asked to
        remove the litter.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The description and extent of existing standard jobs meeting or exceeding
    Intervention Criteria (i.e. standard job defects) and which are permitted
    to remain as such is detailed in Table 752.I021. The Contractor shall be
    responsible for repairing or rectifying all defects excess of the nominated
    quantity of unit of work for each nominated standard job.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may direct that the permitted quantity be reduced as a
    result of existing standard job defects being repaired or rectified,
    either:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) through work carried out under the Contract under a Provisional
    Quantity Item, as a variation or as Dayworks;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    or
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) as a result of work undertaken by another party.
