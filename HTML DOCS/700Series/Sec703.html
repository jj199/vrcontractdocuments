    703.08 PLACING, COMPACTING AND FINISHING CONCRETE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be transported, handled and placed to prevent segregation,
    loss or leakage of materials. Fresh concrete shall not be placed against
    concrete which has taken its initial set, except at properly formed
    construction joints. Concrete shall be thoroughly compacted by means of
    continuous tamping and internal vibration and shall be worked around any
    embedments and into corners of formwork or excavations to produce a dense
    concrete free from voids, honeycombing, segregation or surface defects.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unformed surfaces shall be hand tamped to ensure a smooth surface with a
    uniform colour and appearance, and screeded to achieve the specified level,
    dimensions, falls and tolerances.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Geopolymer concrete shall be placed and finished in accordance with this
    clause and the geopolymer manufacturer's placement guidelines.
    <p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing of exposed concrete surfaces shall commence immediately after
    finishing operations are progressively completed and shall continue
    uninterrupted for a period of not less than 7 days after placing the
    concrete, with the exception of concrete edgings which shall be cured for a
    period of not less than three days after placing the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be cured either by water curing, wet hessian, polyethylene
    sheeting which is adequately sealed, curing compound or a combination of
    these. Freshly finished exposed concrete surfaces shall be effectively
    protected from rain or damage from other sources, until hard set has
    occurred.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing compounds shall comply with AS 3799. The curing compound shall be
    applied in two coats using a fine spray at the rate stated on the
    certificate of compliance. The curing membrane shall be maintained intact
    for not less than the specified period of curing. Any damage to the curing
    membrane during the period of curing shall be repaired immediately at the
    original rate of application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the curing period, concrete paving and shared use paths shall
    provide a dense, hard wearing surface.

    Geopolymer concrete shall be cured in accordance with the requirements of
    Clause 703.10(a), including the specified minimum curing periods, and as
    follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) The curing methods acceptable for curing of geopolymer concrete are:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) covering with polyethylene sheet
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) maintaining the formwork in place in accordance with the requirements
    of Clauses 610.23(e) and Clause 610.23(f) respectively
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (3) covering with wet hessian blankets. Hessian or burlap mats shall
    consist of at least two layers of hessian having a combined weight of at
    least 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup> dry and shall have a width after shrinkage of at
    least 300 mm greater than necessary to cover the entire width and vertical
    faces of concrete paving and shared use paths. The hessian blankets or mats
    shall be new or have only been used for curing concrete, shall be free from
    tears and shall be soaked in water for at least one hour prior to concrete
    placement proceeding.
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete paving and shared use paths may be constructed with fibre
    reinforced concrete in lieu of steel reinforcement, provided the fibre
    reinforced concrete provides equivalent performance to steel reinforced
    concrete in accordance with this section.

<p>
    (b) Macro Synthetic Fibres
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where it is proposed to replace up to SL82 steel mesh with synthetic
    fibres, such fibres shall be in the form of fine macro synthetic high
    performance fibres produced from virgin polypropylene or copolymer. Macro
    synthetic fibres shall be collated or supplied in water soluble pucks and
    supplied in fully biodegradable bags to ensure that fibres are uniformly
    distributed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Micro synthetic fibres shall not be used alone to replace steel
    reinforcement or to achieve long term crack control. Where required micro
    synthetic fibres shall only be used for control of plastic shrinkage
    cracking, impact and abrasion resistance and explosive spalling resistance
    of concrete. Where specifically designed into concrete paving and shared
    use paths, micro synthetic fibres shall only be used in conjunction with
    macro synthetic fibres or steel fibres or with steel reinforcement.

    As soon as the concrete has cured sufficiently and not earlier than 3 days
    after placing, topsoil material, free from perishable matter and lumps,
    shall be placed and firmly compacted in layers not exceeding 150 mm in
    thickness and to a width not less than 300 mm behind the edging to the top
    of the edging.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where edging has been constructed alongside an existing pavement, part of
    which has been excavated to permit the construction of the edging, the
    excavated space shall be backfilled to the surface level of the existing
    pavement. Size 7 or Size 10 asphalt shall be used for this work and firmly
