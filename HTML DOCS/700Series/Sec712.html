</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Before obstructing any waterway, channel, culvert, or pipe, the
        Contractor shall make provision for temporary diversion and submit the
        proposal to the Superintendent for review.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall make provision for the safe discharge of drainage and
    storm water at all times during the construction of the Works.
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    712.07 TRIMMING AND BEDDING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The areas on which block paving is to be placed shall be trimmed by the
    Contractor to an even and stable surface to allow a layer of bedding
    material not less than the minimum specified thickness to be placed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lower bedding shall consist of graded crushed rock or natural gravel,
    watered as necessary and compacted to form a hard, dense surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Upper bedding shall consist of bedding sand complying with the requirements
    of Clause 712.02 placed in accordance with the following requirements:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Sand shall be spread loose in a uniform layer of 30 mm nominal
    thickness and shall be screeded in a loose condition to achieve a layer of
    uniform thickness, to the specified design level, following compaction of
    the paving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) The spread sand shall be carefully maintained in a loose condition and
    protected against precompaction both prior to and following screeding. Sand
    shall be lightly screeded in a loose condition to the predetermined depth
    just ahead of the laying of the paving units. Under no circumstances shall
    the sand be screeded in advance of the laying face to an extent to which
    paving will not be completed on that day.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    712.08 EDGE TREATMENT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where it is specified that paving shall match concrete edgings any
    protrusions on the line of the edging shall be removed to allow paving
    blocks to be placed abutting a straight edge. Chamfered blocks shall be
    placed adjacent to all concrete edgings with the lower edge of the chamfer
    set at the level of the top of the edging.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Where concrete edging does not exist and is not specified, the Contractor
    shall supply and construct a timber edge strip to match the finished level
    of paving. Unless otherwise specified the edge strip shall be constructed
    from rough sawn 100 mm x 50 mm pressure treated Standard Grade Radiata Pine
    using the longest lengths that are practicable in each situation. The strip
    shall be firmly bedded and supported by 100 mm x 50 mm hardwood or pressure
    treated radiata pine stakes 450 mm long placed at each end of a timber
    strip with intermediate stakes at no more than 2 m intervals. The stakes
    shall be placed on the opposite side of the strip to the paving, driven to
    a level 25 mm below the top of the timber edging, and secured to the strip
    by two 75 mm galvanized nails.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Following installation of the edge strip the ground surface not to be paved
    adjacent to the strip, shall be reinstated or filled with soil to match the
    finished level of the edge strip.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Part width paving blocks at the edge of the paved area with or without
    concrete edgings, shall be saw&#8209;cut along the line of the edge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    712.09 PROVISION FOR PERMANENT SIGNS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where shown on the drawings or specified, sign post sleeves supplied by
    VicRoads shall be placed by the Contractor to provide for erection of
    permanent signs in the areas to be paved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sign post sleeves will be not greater than 500 mm long and they shall be
    placed vertically with the top of the sleeve 5&#8209;15 mm below the
    finished level of the paving and shall be installed before paving is
    commenced. Any sand or debris which falls into the sleeve shall be removed.
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    712.10 LAYING PAVING BLOCKS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, paving shall be laid in a stretcher bond
    pattern commencing at the longest straight edge with the long sides of the
    pavers parallel to that edge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Paving blocks shall be placed with gaps nominally 2 to 4 mm wide between
    adjacent blocks such that all joints are correctly aligned.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In each row all whole blocks shall be laid first. Closure blocks shall be
    cut and fitted subsequently. Such closure blocks shall consist of not less
    than 25% of a whole block. Spaces less than 25% of a full block shall be
    filled with a mortar consisting of four parts sand and one part cement and
    coloured to match the colour of the paving blocks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Except where it is necessary to correct any minor variations occurring in
    the laying pattern the paving blocks shall not be hammered into position.
    Where adjustment of position is necessary care shall be taken to avoid
    premature compaction of the sand bedding.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any foot or barrow traffic shall use boards overlying and raised above the
    paving to prevent disturbance of blocks prior to compaction. No other
    construction traffic shall be allowed on the paving at this stage of
    construction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    712.11 COMPACTION AND JOINT FILLING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As soon as practicable after laying the paving blocks, the paving joints
    shall be filled with joint filling sand and the paving shall be compacted.
    Joint filling sand shall be spread over the paving and broomed into the
    joints and not less than two passes of a plate compactor shall be used with
    compaction and brooming continuing until lipping has been eliminated
    between blocks and the joints completely filled with sand. Any blocks that
    are cracked or broken during compaction shall be immediately removed and
    replaced. All paving shall be fully compacted on the day of laying,
    provided that compaction shall not proceed closer than 1 m from any face
    where paving will be continued.
