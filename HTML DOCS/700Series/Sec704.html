    704.03 PLACING OF PRECAST KERBS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Preparation of Base
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The foundation shall be excavated or filled to levels 75 mm below the
    levels fixed for the base of the kerb. All soft, wet or unstable material
    shall be removed to a further depth of 75 mm and the resulting space filled
    with earth, sand or gravel of a quality that when moistened and compacted
    will form a stable foundation. Bedding material consisting of sand, gravel
    or crushed rock shall then be placed and fully compacted to the specified
    level.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Placing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The kerb shall be set so that the top conforms with the line and grade
    specified within a tolerance of &#177;15 mm. All sections shall be firmly
    butted together.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    704.04 PLACING OF PRECAST SPIKED KERBS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where precast kerbs are to be pinned to existing pavements, they shall be
    placed true to line with adjoining sections firmly butted together. Where
    necessary, the sections shall be bedded on 6 to 1 cement mortar in order to
    maintain an even grade along the top of the kerb.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The kerb sections shall be held in position by 12 mm diameter steel spikes
    300 mm long driven into the pavement so that the tops are at least 10 mm
    below the tops of the kerbs. The holes in the tops of the kerbs shall then
    be filled level with the top with 3 to 1 cement mortar.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    704.05 BACKFILLING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where specified filling shall be placed and thoroughly compacted behind and
    up to the level of the top of the kerb.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
