    760.03 INSTALLATION OF ANCHORS AND ERECTION OF COLUMNS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Anchors
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolts shall have a maximum grade of 4.6 or equivalent if other types of
    anchor are used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A minimum of eight anchors shall be used in each column base-plate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Anchors for gantry and light mast structures shall be cast into the
    foundation pile cap. Retro-fitted expanding or bonded anchors in drilled or
    cored holes shall not be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A cast-in double anchor cradle shall be used to achieve correct relative
    positioning and alignment of cast-in anchors and holes in base-plates.
    Anchor cradles shall connect all of the anchors into a rigid arrangement
    and shall be made of weldable steel plates with a minimum width of 3 x
    anchor diameter and a minimum thickness of 5 mm, fabricated in accordance
    with Section 630. Double anchor cradles shall comprise two identical
    frames, one at the lower end of the anchors, and another removable frame at
    the upper end, which is to be removed when the foundation or pile-cap has
    gained sufficient strength and prior to erection of the column.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On completion of casting of the foundation, all projecting anchors shall be
    vertical or as shown on the drawings, be mutually parallel, and it shall be
    possible to place the base-plate into its final position on the projecting
    anchors without any adjustment of the anchors.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The projecting length of the anchors shall be sufficient to achieve the
    requirements of Bridge Technical Note BTN 014 in respect of the depth of
    the void under the base-plate and the limits on the projecting length of
    the anchor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Anchors that are misaligned, in the wrong position, of insufficient
    projecting length, or have damaged threads, shall be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP If cast-in anchors do not comply, the Contractor must submit
        proposals for rectification to the Superintendent. The use of force to
        correct errors in alignment or position of cast&#8209;in anchors is not
        permitted.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Erection of Columns
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Columns shall be erected in accordance with the vertical alignment
    requirements of and tolerances stated in AS/NZS 5131 - Structural steelwork
    - Fabrication and erection.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Columns shall be supported during erection using appropriate temporary
    structures until all permanent connections have been made, grout has
    achieved its design strength and the structure is stable and capable of
    resisting all working loads.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Levelling Nuts
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Levelling nuts shall be placed on the projecting cast-in anchors and,
    following erection of the column or pole to the required alignment, nuts
    above and the levelling nuts below the base-plate shall be tensioned to
    snug-tight against the base-plate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Top-nuts shall then be tensioned by the part-turn method as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Anchor-bolt diameter &#8804; 37.5 mm 1/6 turn beyond snug tight
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Anchor-bolt diameter &gt; 37.5 mm 1/12 turn beyond snug tight
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Grouting of Voids Under Base-plates
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the drawings require the use of grout to fill the void under the
    base-plate, it shall be a high early strength (minimum nominal strength of
    50 MPa), free-flowing, non-shrink proprietary material. The use of
    sand:cement mortar or cement grout to fill the void is not permitted. The
    void under the base-plate must be filled to a level 10 mm above the
    underside of the base-plate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grout must be mixed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations
    using a mechanical mixer which has sufficient volume to mix the grout
    required for one base-plate in a single mix.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grout must be placed in its final position within the maximum time limit
    recommended by the manufacturer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Formwork
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork for grout must be sealed to prevent leakage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork must be provided on all sides or around the full perimeter of the
    base-plate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) Grouting
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grout must be poured in a single continuous operation to the required
    level.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Neither the formwork, base-plate or fluid grout shall be vibrated or
    tapped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grout must then be cured in accordance with the manufacturer's
    instructions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (g) Grout-testing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cube tests shall be taken at a minimum rate of one set of four per day. The
    set of cubes shall represent the whole of the day's production of grout.
    Two cubes shall be tested at 7 and 28 days respectively. The results of the
    cube tests shall be reported to the Superintendent within 7 days of
    testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        If the grout does not achieve the required 28&#8209;day strength, the
        Contractor shall submit proposals for rectification to the
        Superintendent.

    760.04 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CANTILEVER SIGN STRUCTURES WITH
    CANTILEVER ARMS OF HORIZONTAL LENGTH GREATER THAN 9 M
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In the case of design and construct contracts, if the design requires a
    cantilever arm more than 9 m in length, the Contractor shall provide and
    install vibration monitoring equipment and monitor vibrations in the
    structure for a period of 12 months immediately following completion of the
    structure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Vibration monitoring shall be achieved by measuring variations in strain at
    the base-plate weld to establish that the strain range is less than the
    relevant constant-amplitude fatigue limit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall collect and interpret the vibration data and prepare a
    report on the performance of the structure which shall include an
    assessment of its fatigue life. The Contractor shall employ suitably
    experienced professionals to provide advice on vibration monitoring and to
    prepare the assessment of fatigue life.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Proposals for vibration monitoring together with the collection and
    interpretation of data shall be subjected to proof-engineering by a
    pre-qualified consultant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The Contractor shall submit its finalised proposals for vibration
        monitoring and reporting to the Superintendent for review not later
        than four weeks prior to the commencement of vibration monitoring.
