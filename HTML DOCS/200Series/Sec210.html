</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for the supply, handling and placing
    of geotextiles as listed below or used as a separation layer, or as a
    separation and filtration layer, in earthworks at locations shown on the
    drawings or specified.

    210.02 SUPPLY OF MATERIALS
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall supply the geotextiles as specified in Clause 210.07
    and as shown on the drawings. The physical and mechanical properties of the
    geotextiles shall be provided in accordance with Clause 210.03.
</p>
<p>
    After delivery of the geotextiles to site, the Contractor shall ensure that
    the geotextiles are kept clean and undamaged and stored away from direct
    sunlight until covered. Any damaged or improperly stored geotextiles shall
    be replaced by the Contractor.

    manufactured from synthetic fibres of a long chain polymer such as
    polypropylene, polyethylene, polyester or similar.
</p>
<p>
    Woven geotextiles shall have filaments interlaced in two sets, mutually at
    right angles. One set shall be parallel to the longitudinal direction of
    the geotextile.
</p>
<p>
    Non woven geotextiles shall have filaments bonded by needle punching, heat
    or chemical bonding processes.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Robustness
</p>
<p>

<p>
    The geotextile shall be stabilised against deterioration due to
    ultra&#8209;violet radiation such that when tested in accordance with AS
    3706.11, the geotextile must have retained strength of at least 50% after

        Specification Section shall meet the requirements of AS ISO/IEC 17025.
        All test reports shall be endorsed in accordance with the AS ISO/IEC
        17025 accreditation for that laboratory. Testing laboratories shall
        comply with the resource requirements for competent testing personnel
        and appropriate supervision as required by AS ISO/IEC 17025. (Test
        reports may be called test certificates.)

    NOTE: Accreditation bodies which are signatories to the International
    Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) Mutual Recognition Arrangement
    (MRA) for testing laboratories can offer accreditation against the
    requirements of AS ISO/IEC 17025. A listing of ILAC signatories is
available from the ILAC website (    <a href="http://www.ilac.org">www.ilac.org</a>). In Australia, the National
Association of Testing Authorities (NATA,    <a href="https://www.nata.com.au">https://www.nata.com.au</a>) is a

    of the material properties specified in Clause 210.03(b), (c) and (d).
</p>
<p>
    Test certificates shall be submitted for each delivery of geotextile
    supplied to the works. Test certificates for the same material produced and
    tested within 12 months prior to the proposed use will be accepted, except
    for geotextile material used in structural applications, as detailed in
    Table 201.032, below.
</p>
<p>
    Where no test certification is provided, test samples from each roll of
    geotextile shall be selected and the test results reported in accordance

    210.04 PREPARATION
</p>
<p>
    Prior to placing any geotextiles the Contractor shall excavate the surface
    material to the depth shown on the drawings or specified. The area shall
    then be trimmed to provide a uniform surface freely draining to points
    clear of the road formation.
</p>
<p>
    Where the surface having been trimmed becomes unstable for whatever reason,
    the Contractor shall treat in situ or remove and replace the unstable
    material to the condition that the surface has the required strength to
    support the weight of construction traffic and plant and no additional
    payment shall be made for this work.
</p>
<p>
    210.05 PLACING GEOTEXTILES AND BACKFILLING
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        The placement of geotextile is not permitted without the written
        approval of the Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall place the specified geotextile to the limits as shown
    on the drawings or specified. The geotextile shall be subject to a visual
    inspection by the Contractor's geotechnical consultant during placing. A
    certificate of compliance shall be provided by the Contractor's
    geotechnical consultant to verify that the coverage and ground preparation
    for placement of the geotextile have been executed in accordance with the
    drawings and this specification.
</p>
<p>
    The geotextile shall be placed without punctures or tears and, if these
    occur, they shall be rectified or the entire roll of geotextile replaced
    prior to covering. Any rolls with imperfections shall not be used.
    Geotextiles used in subsurface drains shall be placed to conform
    approximately to the shape of the excavation. The geotextile shall fully
    envelop the drainage material in the excavation. All joints shall be
    overlapped or sewn in accordance with requirements specified in Clause
    210.07. Geotextiles shall be covered by filling within 48 hours of
    placement.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (b) Type B Material
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall supply and place over the geotextile Type B material
    of maximum particle size of not more than 150 mm and moisture ratio of not
    less than 85% as determined by test using the Standard compactive effort.
    The initial layer of Type B material shall be placed and compacted to the
    maximum density practicable without causing further instability in the
    underlying materials upon which the geotextile has been placed. Subsequent
    layers of Type B material shall also be placed to the maximum density
    practicable until stability is achieved and a layer satisfies the test
    rolling requirements specified in Section 204 as applicable. Any remaining
    layers of fill to be placed above the stable layer shall be placed and
    compacted in accordance with the requirements of Section 204 as applicable.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Permeable Fill Material
</p>
<p>
    Where shown on the drawings or specified, the Contractor shall supply and
    place permeable fill material of the depth specified in Clause 210.07 over
    the geotextile. The geotextile shall be of the type of filtration and
    separation classification. The permeable fill material shall comply with
    the requirements of Clause 210.06 and have a moisture content compatible
    with achieving maximum density practicable. The initial layer of permeable
    fill material shall be placed and compacted to the maximum density
    practicable without causing further instability or loss of shape to the
    trimmed surface upon which the geotextile has been placed. Any subsequent
    layers of permeable fill material shall also be placed to the maximum
    density practicable until the full depth of permeable fill material
    specified has been placed.
</p>
<p>
    Following placement of the specified depth of permeable fill material, a
    second layer of geotextile (filtration and separation) shall be placed as
    specified to completely enclose the permeable fill material before
    placement of Type B material commences.
</p>
<p>
    210.06 SUPPLY OF PERMEABLE FILL MATERIAL ##(strikethrough (a) or (b)):
</p>
<p>
    For the purpose of this section, permeable fill material shall:
</p>
<p>
    (a) comply with the requirements of Section 204;
</p>
<p>
    (b) consist of hard, durable and clean sand or gravel, or crushed stone
    from a source rock with a Los Angeles Abrasion Loss of not more than 45;
</p>
<p>
    (c) have maximum particle size not exceeding 19 mm and a permeability not
    less than 10<sup>-4</sup>m/sec when compacted to a density ratio value of
    100% based on Standard compactive effort.
