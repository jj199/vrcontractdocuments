    Type A structural material shall be placed in accordance with the
    requirements of Clauses 204.11 and 204.13.
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Type B Material
</p>
<p>
    Type B material shall be placed in locations shown on the drawings, or if
    surplus Type B material is available, it may be used in locations specified
    for Type C material. The highest quality Type B materials available shall
    be reserved for placement in the higher levels of Type B fills being
    constructed.
</p>
<p>
    Type B material shall be spread and compacted in layers not exceeding a
    compacted thickness of 200 mm.
</p>
<p>
    Where Type B material contains 25% or more of rock by volume, which will
    not break down during compaction to meet the maximum particle dimension
    required for a 200 mm thick layer, the loose thickness of each layer may
    equal 125% of the typical maximum particle dimension of the rock up to a
    maximum layer thickness of 500 mm. Any rock with a maximum particle
    dimension greater than 80% of the loose thickness of the layer shall be
    removed. The material shall be placed and compacted such that voids are
    completely filled with fine material.
</p>
<p>
    Type B material containing rock with a particle dimension greater than 150
    mm after compaction shall not be placed within 400 mm of the top of Type B
    and/or Type C material zones.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (iv) Type C Material
</p>
<p>
    Type C material shall be placed in locations shown on the drawings or in
    other areas approved by the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    Type C material shall be spread and compacted in layers not exceeding a
    compacted thickness of 300 mm.
</p>
<p>
    Where Type C material contains 25% or more of rock by volume, which will
    not break down during compaction to meet the maximum particle dimension
    required for a 300 mm thick layer, the loose thickness of each layer may
    equal the maximum particle dimension of the rock up to a maximum layer
    thickness of 500 mm.
</p>
<p>
    Rocks with a maximum particle dimension of less than 800 mm may be placed
    in Type C material zones as specified, with sufficient spacing between
    larger rocks to enable full compaction of the Type C material.
</p>
<p>
    The material shall be placed and compacted such that voids are completely
    filled with fine material.
</p>
<p>
    204.11 FILL AT STRUCTURES
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
</p>
<p>
    This clause covers the requirements for the placement and compaction of
    fill material adjacent to or preparatory to the construction of structures
    such as bridge abutments, retaining walls, wing walls, crown units and
    culverts with an opening height greater than 1200 mm. Such material shall
    be placed at locations as specified or shown on the drawings.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Fill at Structures
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        No fill shall be placed against or within 3 m of a structure until the
        foundation for the fill has been reviewed by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the placement of Type A material at bridge abutments as
    structural material, embankment material or backfilling within 3 metres of
    retaining walls, wing walls, all crown units, and culverts with an opening
    height greater than 1200 mm, shall be material of at least Type A material
    quality.
</p>
<p>
    No material shall be placed against concrete within 14 days of casting.
</p>
<p>
    Unless a geocomposite drainage mat is specified as a drainage medium,
    material to be placed within 300 mm of bridge abutments, retaining walls,
    wing walls or large culverts shall consist of permeable fill material which
    meets the requirements of Clause 204.04. The permeable fill material shall
    be placed in conjunction with the adjacent fill in layers not exceeding 150
    mm compacted thickness, and compacted to refusal using hand held mechanical
    equipment. The bottom of the permeable fill material or any geocomposite
    drainage mat shall be connected to suitable drainage outfalls by subsurface
    drainage pipes as shown on the drawings or as otherwise specified.
</p>
<p>
    Material to be placed adjacent to permeable fill material or geocomposite
    drainage mat within 3 m of the face of structures shall be Type A
    structural material which meets the requirements of Clause 204.04. Such
    material shall be spread and compacted as specified in horizontal layers
    not exceeding 150 mm compacted thickness.
</p>
<p>
    Compaction plant shall not be operated within the minimum distances from
    structures shown in Table 204.111. These minimum distances apply until the
    fill reaches the level above the top of the structure corresponding to the
    relevant specified minimum cover.
</p>
<p>
    The difference in level of any fill being placed on opposite sides of a
    structure or structural component shall not exceed H/4 or 500 mm, whichever
    is the lesser, where H is the height of the structure.

<p>
    Fills shall be compacted to either Compaction Scale A, Scale B or Scale C
    as nominated in Clause 204.16. Where the compaction scale has not been
    specified, Compaction Scale A shall apply. Testing for compaction shall be
    undertaken in accordance with VicRoads Code of Practice 500.05.
</p>
<p>
    (a) Test Lots
</p>
<p>
    A test lot shall be as defined in Section 173. The lot size for Type A,
    Type B and Type C material shall be as specified in Table 204.142.
</p>
<p>
    The calculation of density ratio and moisture ratio shall be based on
    laboratory values determined using standard compactive effort.
</p>
<p>
    For work to be tested for compliance with Scale A or Scale B compaction
    requirements, the number of tests per lot shall be six, unless the lot is
    to be treated as a small lot in accordance with Section 173.

    nominal size after compaction of 40 mm or less shall be compacted to comply
    with the requirements of Table 204.131.
</p>
<p>
    Each lot to be tested for compaction shall be test rolled in accordance
    with Section 173. Any unstable areas shall be excluded from the lot and
    shall be rectified by the Contractor and assessed separately. If the total
    area of the excluded areas exceeds 20% of the area of the lot, the whole of
    the lot shall be rejected.

<p>
    (ii) Material of Nominal Size Greater than 40 mm (after Compaction)
</p>
<p>
    All fill material and ripped and re-compacted material in cuts below Cut
    Floor Level with a nominal size after compaction greater than 40 mm shall
    be compacted using a grading, mixing, watering and rolling procedure as
    agreed by the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may require that trial sections be constructed to verify
    that the proposed compaction routine is acceptable. No additional payment
    will be made for any requirement to construct trial sections.
</p>
<p>
    All fill material and material below the Cut Floor Level shall be compacted
    at minimum moisture ratio of 80%. The moisture ratio shall be determined
    using the material which passes the 37.5 mm sieve, where the material
    contains less than 20% oversize material. If the material contains more
    than 20% oversize material, the moisture ratio shall be determined using an
    alternative method in accordance with the appropriate test method or Code
    of Practice.
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of work for compaction will be based on compliance with the
    accepted placement and compaction procedure and test rolling carried out in
    accordance with Section 173.
</p>
<p>
    Any unstable areas detected by test rolling shall be rectified. Where
    unstable areas exceed 20% of the area being test rolled, the whole of the
    area shall be ripped, re&#8209;compacted as specified above, and
    re&#8209;presented for test rolling.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (c) Treatment of Expansive Materials
</p>
<p>
    All material with a percentage swell equal to or greater than 2.5% shall be
    considered as expansive and shall be treated in accordance with Clause
    204.06(e)(i) and Clause 204.10(d)(iii).
</p>
<p>
    All layers of Type A material placed over expansive Type B or expansive in
    situ material, shall be maintained at a characteristic moisture ratio of
    not less than 90% for the period between completion of compaction and
    placement of the overlying layer.
</p>
<p>
    Expansive material shall be placed at a characteristic moisture ratio of
    90% to 110% during compaction, maintained through test rolling and up to
    placement of the overlying layer.
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor may nominate a lesser characteristic moisture ratio for
    agreement of the Superintendent if it can demonstrate that complying with
    the above requirement will result in the material being unstable under a
    test roll performed in accordance with the requirements of Section 173.
</p>
<p>
    Where the nominal size of material after compaction is greater than 40 mm,
    the moisture ratio shall be determined on that material which passes the
    19.0 mm sieve, otherwise the moisture ratio shall be determined on the
    material passing the 37.5 mm sieve or 19.0 mm sieve taking into account
    oversize material as required by the test method.
</p>
<p>
    204.14 FREQUENCY OF TESTING
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out testing at a frequency which is sufficient
    to ensure that the materials and work supplied under the Contract complies
    with the specified requirements. Notwithstanding this requirement, testing
    shall be undertaken at either Scale A or Scale B level of testing, at a
    frequency not less than that specified below. Where the scale of testing
    has not been specified, Scale A shall apply.
</p>
<p>
    (a) Material Properties Testing - Scale A
</p>
<p>
    (i) CBR and Percentage Swell
</p>
<p>
    Materials shall be tested to demonstrate compliance with the material
    property requirements specified in Clause 204.04. Where Scale A is
    specified, the following frequency of testing shall apply.
</p>
<p>
    The initial lot of each material type shall be tested to determine the
    Assigned CBR (strength) and percentage swell of the material and shall be
    carried out in accordance with VicRoads Code of Practice RC500.20. Unless
    otherwise approved by the Superintendent sampling for CBR testing shall be
    undertaken after field compaction of the initial lot. If either the
    Assigned CBR value or percentage swell value does not meet the requirements
    specified in Clause 204.04, the lot shall be rejected and all subsequent
    material from that source will be considered as non-conforming for that
    use.
</p>
<p>
    Where both the Assigned CBR and percentage swell values meet the
    requirements of Clause 204.04 the material will be considered to be
    conforming subject to it complying with other specified requirements, and
    the Contractor may seek the Superintendent's agreement to undertake future
    testing for CBR and percentage swell at the reduced frequency specified in
    Table 204.141.
</p>
<p>
    The continued acceptance of Assigned CBR and percentage swell will be
    assessed against the CBR and percentage swell values of a single CBR test
    and a single percentage swell test. Provided that the single CBR test value
    is greater than the specified Assigned CBR value and that the percentage
    swell value is less than the specified percentage swell value, the lot
    shall be accepted for CBR and percentage swell.
</p>
<p>
    Should either the single CBR value be less than the specified Assigned CBR
    or the percentage swell value be greater than the specified swell value,
    the lot shall be retested for Assigned CBR and percentage swell values.
</p>
<p>
    The values obtained from the new Assigned CBR and percentage swell tests
    shall comply with the requirements of Clause 204.04 and shall be considered
    to be the new Assigned CBR and percentage swell values. Subject to
    compliance to Clause 204.04, single test verification of the Assigned CBR
    and percentage swell shall continue at the reduced testing frequency.
</p>
<p>
    Should either the verification tests for the Assigned CBR and/or percentage
    swell value not comply with the requirements of Table 204.041, the material
    from that source will be considered as non conforming and the lot and any
    subsequent lots from that source will be rejected.
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (ii) Gradings, PI, LL, Permeability and Particle Dimension
</p>
<p>
    Testing for grading, PI, LL, permeability and maximum particle dimension
    shall be undertaken at the initial testing frequency specified in Table
    204.141 until three consecutive lots of like material and work have
    achieved the specified requirements. After satisfying this requirement, the
    Contractor may seek the Superintendent's agreement to reduce the frequency
    of testing of subsequent lots to the reduced testing frequency specified in
    Table 204.141.
</p>
<p>
    If the Contractor has obtained the Superintendent's agreement to reduce the
    frequency of testing and any lot fails to achieve the specified
    requirements, all testing of all subsequent lots shall be undertaken in
    accordance with the initial testing frequency in Table 204.141 until three
    consecutive lots of like material and work have achieved the specified
    requirements in the first test. After satisfying this requirement, the
    Contractor may again reduce the frequency of testing to the reduced testing
    frequency specified in Table 204.141.
</p>
<p>
    If a material source changes, or the properties of a material differ from
    the material initially tested, a new testing regime shall be established in
    accordance with this clause.

    (b) Material Properties Testing - Scale B
</p>
<p>
    Where Scale B is specified in Table 204.161, the first lot of each material
    type shall be tested to demonstrate compliance with the material property
    requirements specified in Clause 204.04.
</p>
<p>
    Where the first lot of each material type satisfies the material property
    requirements in Clause 204.04 as applicable to that material type, no
    further testing will be required for that material except where changes to
    the physical properties of the material are observed or where directed by
    the Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    Where the first lot of each material type does not satisfy the material
    property requirements in Clause 204.04 as applicable to the material type,
    the lot will be rejected.
</p>
<p>
    (c) Compaction and Moisture Content Testing Frequency
</p>
<p>
    Every lot shall be tested initially to demonstrate compliance with the
    requirements for compaction and moisture content. Testing of every lot
    shall continue until three consecutive lots of like material and work have
    achieved the specified requirements in the first test. After satisfying
    this requirement and establishing a compaction procedure to the
    satisfaction of the Superintendent, the Contractor may seek the
    Superintendent's agreement to reduce the frequency of testing of subsequent
    lots to the minimum requirements specified in Table 204.142.
</p>
<p>
    If the Contractor has obtained the Superintendent's agreement to test for
    compaction and moisture content at the minimum testing frequency and any
    lot fails to achieve the specified requirements, testing of all subsequent
    lots shall be undertaken until three consecutive lots of like material and
    work have achieved the specified requirements in the first test. After
    satisfying this requirement, the Contractor may submit changes to the
    compaction procedure for the Superintendent's review and may again seek
    approval to reduce the frequency of testing to the minimum requirements.
</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of this sub&#8209;clause, small areas as defined in
    Section 173 shall not be included in the initial consecutive lots tested
    for compliance, nor any subsequent set of consecutive lots.

    204.17 TOPSOILING
</p>
<p>
    Topsoiling shall not be placed over cut and fill areas until the Contractor
    has verified that such areas comply with the requirements in Clause 204.03
</p>
<p>
    All unpaved cut and fill areas within the limits of the batters, including
    batter roundings but excluding cut batters steeper than 1.5 to 1
    (horizontal to vertical), and any other area disturbed by the Contractor's
    operations, shall be topsoiled to the following thicknesses measured normal
    to the slope:
</p>
<p>
    (a) batters with slopes of 2 to 1 (horizontal to vertical) or steeper
    &#8209; 50 mm minimum
</p>
<p>
    (b) tree and shrub plantation bed areas other than (a) above - 100 mm
    minimum
</p>
<p>
    (c) verges: In areas without kerb and channel or concrete edging strips the
    depth of topsoil shall vary uniformly from 50 mm deep at the outside edge
    of verge to 20 mm deep within 100 mm of the edge of seal or asphalt surface
    treatment
</p>
<p>
    (d) all other areas &#8209; 75 mm minimum.
</p>
<p>
    Topsoil shall be placed and levelled but not compacted except for verge
    areas, which shall be compacted. Topsoil on batters shall be placed so as
    to prevent rilling.
</p>
<p>
    The surface level of topsoil shall match the finished surface level, or
    level of back of kerb or concrete edging, as appropriate.
</p>
