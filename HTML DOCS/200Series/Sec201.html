    201.01 DESCRIPTION
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for site clearing and grubbing and for
    the management of the materials generated.
</p>
<p>
    201.02 DEFINITION
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Clearing and Grubbing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Clearing and grubbing is the removal within specified limits of:
</p>
<p>
    (a) vegetation such as trees, tree stumps, tree roots, logs, brush, noxious
    weeds and decayed vegetable matter
</p>
<p>
    (b) refuse such as pole stumps, rubbish dumps and sawdust piles resting on
    or protruding from the ground surface
</p>
<p>
    (c) obstructions such as concrete paving, concrete edgings, drainage pits,
    foundations, fences and disused structures, but not underground
    obstructions such as drainage pipes, service conduits and fuel tanks.
</p>
<p>
    201.03 LIMITS OF WORK
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, the limits of clearing and grubbing shall be:
</p>
<p>
    (a) the whole length between the following chainages:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>***</strong>
    ##(restrict this entry to one typed line):
</p>
<p>
    (b) the whole width between the outside edges of any batters, including any
    roundings, together with a further horizontal distance of 1 m beyond the
    outside edges of batters but not beyond the road reserve boundary or, where
    catch drains are required, to the outside edges of catch drains
</p>
<p>
    (c) not more than the width required for completion of the work under the
    Contract.
</p>
<p>
    201.04 CLEARING
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, the area within the specified limits shall be
    cleared of all vegetation, refuse and obstructions down to natural surface.
    The Contractor shall not undertake any clearing work or any type of
    disturbance outside of the specified limits of work unless approved by the
    Superintendent.
</p>
<p>
    Trees shall be brought down in such manner as to avoid danger to personnel
    and traffic or damage to other trees, shrubs, structures or property
    outside the area being cleared or designated to be retained within the area
    being cleared.
</p>
<p>
    Where the road passes through Crown Land or State Forest, royalties are
    payable by the Contractor to the Department of Environment, Land, Water and
    Planning (DELWP) for all timber which in the opinion of the DELWP is
    suitable for milling or for other commercial use.
</p>
<p>
    Tree branches extending over the carriageway shall be trimmed to provide a
    clearance of at least 6 m above the carriageway surface. Where whole
    branches are to be removed, the Contractor shall use the three cut method
    which requires:
</p>
<p>
    (a) the under cut
</p>
<p>
    (b) the upper cut (further away from the trunk than (a) above) to remove
    the branch
</p>
<p>
    (c) the final trim cut which is to be cut close to the main trunk but
    outside the branch collar.
</p>

<p>
    201.05 GRUBBING
</p>
<p>
    In areas where excavation will be made, all vegetation, refuse and
    obstructions shall be totally grubbed or grubbed to a depth of not less
    than 0.3 m below the subgrade and batters, whichever is the lesser
    treatment.
</p>
<p>
    In areas to be covered by embankments, all vegetation, refuse and
    obstructions shall be grubbed to a depth of not less than 0.3 m below the
    stripped surface or not less than 0.6 m below the finished surface of the
    subgrade, whichever is the lesser treatment. In areas to be covered by
    embankments exceeding 1 m in height, foundations may remain if located or
    cut off not more than 0.4 m above the natural surface but not less than 1 m
    below subgrade.
</p>
<p>
    Pits which are no longer required shall be removed or broken back to a
    depth not less than 0.3 m below the finished surface of the subgrade.
    Remaining pipe openings shall be sealed with concrete. Any remnants of pits
    shall be backfilled with material and compacted to a density ratio of not
    less than 95%. The calculation of density ratio shall be based on Standard
    compactive effort.
</p>
<p>
    Holes resulting from grubbing shall be backfilled with material similar to
    the surrounding material and compacted to the same degree as the
    surrounding material.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise shown on the drawings, trees and stumps within 10 m of any
    portion of a proposed bridge, or proposed culvert having a waterway area
    greater than 6 m2, shall be cleared and grubbed.
</p>
<p>
    Clearing and grubbing at bridge and culvert sites shall conform to the
    other relevant requirements of this section.
