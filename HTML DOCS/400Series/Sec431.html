</p>
<p>
    Coloured surface treatments provide a trafficable surface that is coloured
    for enhanced delineation for specific road uses. The treatment consists of
    a coloured binder applied to the existing road surface, and coloured
    aggregate spread over the binder surface. A coloured surface treatment may
    include an additional layer of coloured binder or protective sealer over

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sideways force coefficient, also called sideways friction coefficient, is a
    general term for the ratio of the resistance to sideways motion to the
    normal component of force between the tyres of a vehicle and the road
    surface when using sideway force test equipment.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All loose material, grit, stones, vegetative matter, and rubbish shall be
    removed from the area of works prior to placement of the coloured surface
    treatment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    preparation shall not cause structural damage to the pavement. All cleaning
    agents and collected material shall be removed from site and disposed in
    accordance with Environment Protection Authority (EPA) Victoria
    requirements for the type of waste generated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Existing pavement markings shall be masked to ensure the coloured surface
    treatment is not applied to the markings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All Raised Reflective Pavement Markers (RRPMs) shall be removed from the
    area of works prior to any coloured surface treatment being placed. New
    RRPMs shall be reinstated after the application of the coloured surface
    treatment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Service pits and valve covers less than 0.03 m2, and drainage grates and
    frames shall also be masked. Larger pit and valve covers shall be covered
    with the coloured surface treatment. All lifting mechanisms and joins
    between the lid and frame shall be masked and protected such that the
    coloured surface treatment does not impede lifting and replacing lids.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any damage caused to the surface by the removal of pavement markings and
    RRPMs shall be repaired prior to placement of the coloured surface
    treatment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The Superintendent shall agree to the method of removal and any
        pavement repairs for pavement markings and RRPMs prior to these works
        occurring.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    All pavement markings covered by the application of coloured surface
    treatments shall be reinstated in accordance with Section 721. This shall
    also apply to any pavement markings or RRPMs which are covered partially or
    wholly by the coloured surface treatment due to inadequate masking.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All excess material shall be removed from the site and disposed in
    accordance with EPA requirements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All masking shall be removed prior to opening the site to traffic.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Excess aggregate shall be removed from the finished surface prior to
    opening the site to traffic. Excess aggregate shall be removed from the
    roadway, kerb and channel, driveways and any adjacent trafficked and
    un&#8209;trafficked areas prior to opening to traffic.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The Superintendent shall agree the site is neat, tidy and free of
        excess aggregate prior to opening to traffic.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    All material which becomes loose after the initial clean-up shall be

    431.11 ACCEPTANCE OF WORK
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Coloured surface treatments shall provide a visually uniform surface with
    uniform aggregate retention, and be free from delamination, stripping and
    areas of wear/scuffing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any work that fails to meet the minimum requirements shall be rectified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of work shall be on a lot basis. Discrete portions of a lot
    which are non-homogeneous with respect to material and appearance shall be
    excluded from the lot and either treated as separate lots, or replaced.
    Where the areas excluded from a lot as non-homogeneous exceed 20% of the
    total lot area, the whole of the lot shall be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Surface Texture
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of work for surface texture shall be based on visual assessment,
    however in marginal cases the Superintendent may request that nominated
    areas be tested in accordance with the test method for assessment of
    surface texture testing as listed in Section 175.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A lot will consist of a single batch or area of like work which has been
    constructed under uniform conditions and is essentially homogeneous with
    respect to material and appearance. A lot shall be the lesser of one day's
    production or each 500 m<sup>2</sup>.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface texture of each test site within the lot shall be a minimum of
    0.6 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Skid Resistance
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may require that the work be tested and assessed for
    skid resistance using one of the following methods:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) SCRIM &#174;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The length of the entire site shall be tested using SCRIM &#174; in the
    left and right wheel paths in every through traffic lane of the site. The
    site shall be tested within 4 weeks of initial placement, and within 8
    weeks prior to the end of the defects liability period. The Superintendent
    may undertake additional skid resistance testing of the site at any time
    during the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The skid resistance of the coloured surface treatment shall be a minimum of
    0.55 sfc at any time during the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Portable Pendulum Friction Tester
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The coloured surface treatment shall be tested using a pendulum friction
    tester in accordance with AS 4663 - Wet method. Each lot shall have 5
    randomly selected test locations selected in accordance with VicRoads test
    method RC316.10 - Selection of test sites within a lot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each lot shall achieve a minimum mean British Pendulum Number (BPN) of 55
    with no individual test location having a BPN of less than 50 at any time
    during the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The method selected to assess skid resistance shall be the most practical
    for the extent and size of work. The Superintendent may require testing at
    any time prior to the end of the defects liability period.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Skid resistance testing will be undertaken at the Superintendent's cost.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Colour
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The colour of the finished surface shall be a Rating 3 Approximate Match
    (or better) with one of the following Australian Standard 2700 &#8209; 2011
    colours as listed in Table 431.111.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The initial colour shall be measured in accordance with Australian Standard
    1580.601.1:1995. Each lot of material shall be tested within 2 days of
    placement. Testing shall be undertaken onsite and under daylight conditions
    only. Each lot of coloured surface treatment shall provide a Rating 3
    Approximate Match (or better) with adjacent lots.
