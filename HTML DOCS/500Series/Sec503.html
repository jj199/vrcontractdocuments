    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for the mix design of all concrete,
    including any other nominated requirements, so that the specified
    durability, strength and other requirements of the hardened and plastic
    concrete are achieved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete used for the construction of the base and subbase pavement
    courses, anchors and subgrade beams shall comply with the requirements of
    Section 610 unless specified otherwise in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The requirements of Clauses 610.05 and 610.06 shall not apply to the
    concrete for base and subbase pavement courses, anchors and subgrade beams.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Requirements for Lean Mix Concrete Subbase Course
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The mean 28 day compressive strength of the concrete mix used for the
    construction of the lean mix concrete subbase course shall be 6 MPa to 15
    MPa. The lean mix concrete shall be sampled and tested in accordance with
    the requirements of Clause 503.05, except that each sample shall consist of
    four specimens tested in accordance with AS 1012. The mean compressive
    strength shall be the average of at least three individual results within a
    range of 2.0 MPa.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum cementitious material content in the lean subbase course mix
    shall be 150 kg/m3 of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Requirements for Concrete Base Pavement Course
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Base course concrete shall have a 28 day characteristic compressive
    strength (f 'c) of 30 MPa to 40 MPa for use in continuously reinforced
    concrete pavements and greater than 30 MPa for jointed concrete pavements.
    This characteristic strength shall be calculated to the nearest 0.1 MPa as
    follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    f 'c = `x &#8209; 1.35s
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    where: f 'c = characteristic compressive strength of the mix
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    `x = mean 28 day compressive strength determined from a sample of three
    specimens of concrete sampled and tested in accordance with the
    requirements of Clause 503.05 and AS 1012.
    <p>

    503.05 ASSESSMENT OF CONCRETE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Assessment of concrete shall be based upon the following criterion:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) 28 day compressive strength values of cylinder specimens cast on site
    with strengths adjusted for in situ density;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) thickness determined from subbase and base surface level measurements;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) rideability as indicated by the Profile Factor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be assessed in lots and all lots shall be tested. A lot
    shall consist of work constructed under essentially uniform conditions and
    is essentially homogeneous with regard to material and appearance. A lot
    shall normally consist of one day's work unless there has been a change in
    materials or mix proportions which could affect the uniformity of the lot,
    or there has been a substantial interruption to the casting process
    requiring a construction joint to be made. In such cases the work shall be
    split into more than one lot and each lot shall be assessed separately for
    compliance with the specification.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Sampling and Testing of Cylinder Specimens
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall sample, prepare, cure and compression test the
    cylinders cast on site in accordance with AS 1012.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be sampled at the point of discharge to the roadbed.
    Each sample shall consist of two cylinder specimens for testing at age 28
    days.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The number of samples in each lot shall be related to the expected volume
    of concrete placed in that lot according to Table 503.051.

    The Contractor shall develop and implement a site sampling procedure to
    ensure the concrete quality for the day's production. Samples shall be
    taken at approximately equal portions of the volume cast in one continuous
    operation. If the casting process is unexpectedly interrupted or terminated
    the samples taken to that time shall represent the lot.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Concrete Cores
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Density and compaction testing shall be based on cores taken from the
    concrete pavement at seven days. The bounds of each base course lot for
    density and thickness testing, and the bounds of each subbase course lot
    for density testing only shall be selected to coincide with the lots
    selected for compressive strength testing and, within the lot, sites for
    testing shall be selected on a random basis except that no site shall be
    selected within 150 mm of a joint or slab edge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For each base course lot ten cores shall be taken.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For each subbase course lot six density tests shall be performed using
    either cored samples or a nuclear gauge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cored specimens taken for density testing shall not be used if they are
    damaged during the coring operation or during transport. Rejected specimens
    shall be replaced with other specimens from the same lot.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall reinstate core holes within 24 hours of cores being
    taken. Core holes shall be reinstated with shrinkage compensating polymer
    modified cementitious material having a compressive strength not less than
    that in the base or subbase as applicable in accordance with the
    requirements of Section 689.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface of the reinstated hole shall be similar to the surrounding
    concrete surface in texture and colour and shall be covered with a curing
    compound.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to trafficking or placement of the subsequent concrete layer the
    cementitious material in the core shall be cured sufficiently to achieve an
    estimated compressive strength of 4 MPa.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Reinstatement of the cored holes shall be completed prior to the
    application of any surface debonding treatment.

    The thickness of a lot shall be determined as follows.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Within the lots defined for assessment of compressive strength the surface
    levels of the subbase shall be measured as specified in Section 173. Levels
    of the base surface shall be taken at the same locations as taken on the
    subbase. For each lot the measured differences (Xi) at each location shall
    be calculated to the nearest 1 mm as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>
        X i = (base level) i &#8209; (subbase level) i
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The departure of the lot thickness from the design thickness shall be
    calculated to the nearest 1 mm as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> T = D &#8209; </strong>
    <strong>`</strong>

    (mm)

    D = design thickness (mm)

    For the subbase course loose material shall be removed from the surface of
    the subgrade and the subgrade shall be wetted to ensure a uniformly moist
    surface at the time of placing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required, the Contractor shall provide concrete sawing equipment at
    the paving site before concrete is placed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall not be placed when the temperature is below 5&#176;C or
    above 35&#176;C and the temperature of concrete, when placed, shall be not
    less than 10&#176;C nor more than 32&#176;C. Concrete shall not be placed
    when rain is falling or when rain is expected within one hour of placing.
    The Contractor shall have available on site sufficient waterproof covers to
    protect the freshly placed concrete against the effects of unexpected rain.
    Covers when required shall be installed in such a manner to not disturb the
    surface of the subbase or base slab.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    at a uniform rate with a minimum of rehandling. The face of freshly placed
    concrete shall be generally vertical, full width of the slab and normal to
    the direction of placing.

<p>
    (b) Trial Concrete Subbase and Base Courses
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to commencing paving of the respective full scale works the
    Contractor shall construct a trial section of both the concrete subbase and
    base using the same materials, concrete mix and equipment as proposed for
    the construction of the full scale works, to satisfy the specification
    requirements. The methods proposed for finishing, texturing, application of
    curing compound, sawing of joints, placement of dowels, tie bars and
    reinforcement shall be demonstrated and documented as part of these trials.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For a mechanical paver a trial length of between 50 and 100 metres at the
    maximum width proposed to be laid shall be constructed in one continuous
    operation. Separate trials are required for each mechanical paver.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For manual paving a trial length of between 15 and 50 metres at the maximum
    width proposed to be laid shall be constructed in one continuous operation
    to a minimum of 25 m3 of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent shall require a new trial section at any stage of the
    full scale works if the Contractor makes any changes to the equipment,
    materials, mix, plant or rate of paving or when concrete as placed and
    jointed does not comply with the Specification.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In the event of deficiencies in the trial concrete the Superintendent may
    require a new length of trial concrete subbase or base, using a modified
    procedure to rectify such deficiencies. Any delays caused through
    deficiencies in the trial sections shall not constitute justification for
    extension of time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the trial sections conform to the specification requirements, they will
    be accepted as part of the works.
    <p>
    </p>

    (c) Placement by Paver
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The paver shall be operated such that a concrete slab having the specified
    alignment profile, ride quality, density and compaction is achieved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete feed shall be arranged such that the paver is operated in a
    continuous forward motion and stoppage of the paver is avoided. Should an
    essentially continuous rate of progress not be maintained, paving
    operations shall cease until appropriate remedial action has been taken.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the paver, the Contractor shall have available at the paving
    site equipment to carry out the following works:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) completion of concreting work to a construction joint in case of paver
    breakdown;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) remedial work to any slab when the paver has not finished the work to
    a satisfactory standard;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) construction of odd shaped areas which cannot be done by a paver.

</p>
<p>
    (d) Manual Placement of Concrete (between Fixed Forms) and Replacement Base
    Slabs
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Replacement slabs and concrete placed manually (between fixed forms) shall
    comply with the base course requirements of Clauses 503.04, 503.05 and
    Clause 610.18.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Forms shall be of sufficient size and rigidity and positioned such that the
    geometry of the compacted and finished concrete satisfies the requirements
    of Clause 503.03. Forms shall be mortar tight and debonded to ensure
    non-adhesion of the concrete to the forms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP </strong>
    <strong>
        Concrete shall not be placed until the Superintendent has reviewed the

        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    During compaction no formwork or reinforcement shall be displaced. Care
    shall be taken to fill every part of the forms to force the concrete under
    and around any reinforcement and any dowels and tie bars and to work coarse
    aggregate back from form surfaces.

    (g) Rate of Evaporation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for measuring concrete temperature and
    wind velocity at the point of concrete placement and for measuring and
    recording air temperature and relative humidity at the site throughout the
    course of the work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When the value of the Rate of Evaporation as determined from Figure 503.071
    exceeds 0.50 kg/m2 per hour the Contractor shall take precautionary
    measures to prevent excessive moisture losses in the form of an evaporative
    retarding compound in accordance with the requirements of Clause 503.18(b).
    If these measures prove unsatisfactory in reducing moisture losses or
    damages the finished surface the Contractor shall cease concreting whilst
    the evaporation rate is in excess of the abovementioned rate or
    satisfactory measures are implemented.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Joints shall be constructed as specified and shown on the drawings. Joints
    shall be straight and vertical. Transverse joints shall be continuous from
    edge to edge of the pavement. Tie bars shall be installed such that
    anchorage strength of at least 85% of the yield strength of the bar is
    developed upon hardening of the base.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Sawn Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sawing shall commence as soon as the concrete has hardened sufficiently to
    permit cutting the concrete without excessive ravelling, regardless of time
    or weather conditions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The line of the joint shall be without any discontinuities. Neither edge
    shall deviate from a 3 metre straight edge by more than 10 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The joint surface shall not exhibit more than 5 mm of vertical or
    horizontal edge ravelling. The length of edge ravelling shall not be more
    than 300 mm in any one (1) metre length of joint on each edge. Saw debris
    shall be washed from the joint and pavement immediately after sawing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Immediately after cleaning a continuous UV&#8209;stabilised PVC spline seal
    5 &#177; 1 mm in diameter shall be installed in the saw cut, and where
    transverse joints cross longitudinal joints the transverse seal shall pass
    under any seal inserted in longitudinal sawn joints. The seal shall not be
    stretched in order to fit into the groove. Any increase in length of the
    seal after installation shall not exceed 10% of the original length. Joints
    in the seal shall be kept to a minimum and shall be cemented together by a
    suitable adhesive. The top of the seal shall not be less than 5 mm nor more
    than 7 mm below the surface of the base.
    <p>

<p>
    (b) Transverse Contraction Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Forming Joints
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Transverse contraction joints shall be sawn. To prevent uncontrolled
    cracking in the base sawn transverse contraction joints shall be
    constructed either skewed or normal to the centreline of the pavement as
    shown on the drawings. The joints shall be constructed to the dimensions
    and details shown on the drawings and initially formed as a sawn groove 3
    mm wide to a depth not less than 1/4 the slab depth, but not exceeding 1/4
    the slab depth plus 10 mm. When the concrete can be cut without excessive
    ravelling the spline seal shall be pushed to the bottom of the initial saw
    cut and the initial groove widened to accommodate the permanent seal.
    Joints shall be sawn in the sequence of concrete placement. Before sawing a
    joint, the base concrete shall be examined closely for cracks and the
    joints shall not be sawn within 1 metre of a crack. In pavements with
    dowelled joints, sawn transverse contraction joints shall be constructed
    normal to the pavement and the joint shall be sawn to coincide with the
    centre of the dowel assemblies. The centre of dowelled assemblies shall be
    suitable referenced prior to concrete placement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Skewed joints shall commence from the right side of the pavement and cross
    in the direction of the design traffic flow at a 1 in 6 skew, unless
    otherwise specified. The joints shall be spaced by repeating the subgroup
    spacing of 4.3 m, 3.7 m, 4.6 m and 4.0 m. The distance between the first
    and last joint of each subgroup shall be 16.6 m &#177; 250 mm and each
    joint within the sequence shall not vary from its designated position by
    more than &#177; 250 mm. Sawn contraction joints specified normal to the
    pavement centreline shall be sawn at 4.5 m intervals. Each joint shall not
    vary from its designated position by more than &#177; 250 mm. The line of
    any sawn joint shall not deviate by more than 20 mm from a 3 metre straight
    edge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sawing of transverse contraction joints shall be carried out in such a
    manner that no more than five unplanned cracks, each with a width not
    exceeding 0.5 mm, occur per successive kilometre of pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where unplanned cracking occurs, the Contractor shall cease paving
    operations until all the joints have been completed and the paving
    operation altered so that further unplanned cracking is prevented.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Temporary Sealing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After the second saw cut is made to form the sealant reservoir and the
    joint thoroughly cleaned of all sawing debris, a continuous
    closed&#8209;cell polyethylene backer rod of diameter shown on the drawings
    shall be inserted into the joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The top of the seal shall be 0 to 10 mm below the concrete surface. The
    backer rod shall pass over any longitudinal joint seal already in place.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The backer rod shall be maintained by the Contractor until the joint is
    sealed permanently. Damaged or disturbed backer rods shall be removed, the
    joint recleaned and a new backer rod inserted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Permanent Sealing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Within 10 days of initial sawing the permanent seal shall be placed in the
    joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The permanent seal shall be either a neoprene compression seal or an in
    situ cast silicone seal complying with the requirements of Clause 503.10.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) Neoprene Seals
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The joint grooves into which the neoprene compression seal is to be
    inserted shall be clean and dry immediately prior to the installation of
    the seal. The sides of the neoprene seal shall be coated with an
    appropriate clear or concrete coloured lubricant&#8209;adhesive compound
    complying with ASTM D&#8209;2835
    <em>
        Specification for Lubricant for Installation of Preformed Compression
        Seals in Concrete Pavements
    </em>
    . The seal shall not be over&#8209;stretched in order to fit into the
    groove and the maximum increase in length of the seal after installation
    shall be 5%. Any seal exceeding 5% extension shall be removed. The seal
    shall be continuous between longitudinal joints and where a discontinuity
    occurs the seal shall be butt jointed. The top of the seal shall not be
    less than 5 mm nor more than 7 mm below the surface of the base and shall
    overlay any longitudinal seals.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) Silicone Seals
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The joint grooves into which the silicone sealant is to be inserted shall
    be clean and dry at the time of installation of the seal. The backer rod
    shall be depressed such that the bottom of the silicone seal shall be at
    the planned location and of the correct shape.

    operation and at any other stage when concrete placement is interrupted for
    30 minutes or longer. Construction joints shall be normal to the pavement
    and constructed to the dimensions and details shown on the drawings. The
    aggregate on the face of the joint shall be exposed prior to casting
    against the exposed face. Care shall be taken to ensure that the concrete
    immediately adjacent to the joint is fully compacted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The line of the joints shall not deviate in from a 3 metre straight edge
    placed along the joint by more than 20 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) For Plain Base
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    transverse contraction joint. Construction joints shall be tied using steel
    bars as shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) For Jointed Reinforced Base
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction joints shall be located at planned transverse contraction
    joints and the joints shall be dowelled as shown on the drawings.
    Construction joints formed at locations other than planned contraction
    joints shall not be within 1.5 m of a contraction joint and shall be tied
    using steel bars as shown on the drawings.
    <p>

<p>
    (d) Expansion Joints &#8209; For All Types of Base
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Expansion joints are generally formed around structures and features which
    project through, into or against the pavement and at other locations as
    specified. Transverse expansion joints shall not be constructed within 2
    metres of a sawn contraction joint. Where necessary the spacing and/or skew
    of the adjacent transverse contraction joints may be changed to ensure
    sufficient clearance is obtained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Expansion joints shall be continuous across the full width of the base
    normal to the control line and constructed in accordance with the drawings.

    Longitudinal joints shall be constructed parallel to the centreline of the
    pavement by the slip formed edge, by fixed formwork or by sawing a 3 mm
    wide cut to a depth not less than one&#8209;third the slab depth but not
    exceeding one&#8209;third the slab depth plus 10 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tie bars of 1 metre long deformed steel bars Grade 410Y 12 mm diameter
    spaced at 500 mm centres located at half the slab depth and placed
    perpendicular to the line of the joint shall be placed in each longitudinal
    joint. If placed by paver, the tie bars shall be inserted automatically.
    For fixed form construction the bars may be placed in the forms but in
    either case tie bars shall not be vibrated into freshly placed concrete.
    For longitudinal joints between the base slab and any kerbs, kerbs and
    channels and open spoon drains, tie bars 600 mm long of 12 mm diameter
    spaced at 500 mm centres shall be installed at half slab depth except
    within 0.5 metre of a transverse contraction joint.
    <p>
    </p>

    503.17 TEXTURING OF SURFACE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Texturing of the concrete surface shall be carried out to the standard of
    surface specified in Clause 503.21 using a hessian drag or steel tines. The
    textured surface shall extend across the full width of the base and shall
    be uniform in appearance.
    <p>

    (a) Texturing of Surface for No Asphalt Overlay
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Light Texturing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete surface shall be textured using a hessian drag.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The hessian drag shall consist of a minimum of two layers of material each
    having a nominal mass of 0.34 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and shall have a length of
    at least 1 metre of material in contact with the concrete surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Medium Texturing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete surface shall be finished to achieve an average texture depth
    between 0.40 mm and 0.70 mm. The texture depth shall generally be achieved
    using steel tining equipment which shall comprise of
    rectangular&#8209;shaped tines of flat spring steel, approximately 0.6 mm
    thick. The width of the tines shall be 2 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Heavy Texturing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete surface shall be finished to achieve an average texture depth
    between 0.50 mm and 1.00 mm. The texture depth shall generally be achieved
    using steel tining equipment which shall comprise of
    rectangular&#8209;shaped tines of flat spring steel, approximately 0.6 mm
    thick. The width of the tines shall be 3 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For texturing with steel tines, the tines shall be spaced between 10 and 21
    mm with a mean spacing between 13 and 14 mm in a random pattern as depicted
    below:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    . 10 14 16 11 10 13 15 16 11 10 21 13 10 .
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    and the tining shall be done transversely.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Should the Contractor wish to use an alternative method to achieve the
        texture depth, details of the proposed method shall be submitted to the
        Superintendent for approval. The Superintendent may require the
        Contractor to cast a sample test panel of size 3 m x 3 m of textured
        concrete prior to approval.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance of the surface texture shall be based on testing of randomly
    selected areas of the surface by the sand patch method to determine the
    average texture depth of that area. Sand patch testing shall be undertaken
    at a frequency of not less than one test per 400 m<sup>2</sup> of concrete
    base surface. Areas found to have an average surface texture depth of less
    than that specified shall be saw grooved parallel to the line of the
    texturing to achieve the specified average texture depth by sawing grooves
    at 20 mm centres.

<p>
    The surface of the concrete shall be lightly textured.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete surface shall be textured using a hessian drag. The hessian
    drag shall consist of a minimum of two layers of material each having a
    nominal mass of 0.34 kg/m2 and shall have a length of at least 1 metre of
    material in contact with the concrete surface.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Curing Compounds
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing of the base and subbase concrete shall be undertaken by the use of a
    curing compound sprayed onto the freshly laid concrete at the application
    rates specified in this clause. Curing compound shall not be sprayed when
    bleed water is present.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Prior to the use of curing compounds, the Contractor shall submit to
        the Superintendent for review not less than four weeks prior to
        placement of concrete
    </strong>
    , full details of the proposed curing method, including the time and rate
    of application, documented evidence of the effectiveness of the compound as
    a curing agent supported by test certificates in accordance with the AS
    ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for the testing laboratory and method of
    removal where required. The test certificates of compliance shall relate
    only to the formulation on which the tests were made and shall be valid for
    not more than three years from the date of issue.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The exposed surfaces of the concrete including the sides of the slab shall
    be treated for curing protection immediately surface finishing has been
    completed. Where any side forms have been used the concrete sides shall be
    treated after stripping of the forms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing protection for base and subbase concrete shall be achieved by the
    application of a chlorinated rubber curing compound and a pigmented wax
    emulsion curing compound respectively , complying with the requirements of
    AS 3799. Two coats shall be applied at the full rate. The compound shall be
    sprayed onto the concrete surface at a rate of 0.2 l/m2 per coat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing compound shall be applied by a pressurised sprayer to give a
    uniform cover except that, for the sides of slabs and for small areas where
    spraying equipment cannot be used, the compound shall be sprayed with a
    hand lance at a rate 25% higher than the rate for mechanically sprayed
    areas. The pressurised sprayer shall incorporate a device for continuous
    agitation and mixing of the compound in its container during spraying. The
    application rate shall be checked by calculating the amount of curing
    compound falling on felt mats, each approximately 0.25 m2 in area, placed
    on the concrete surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The time between the first and second coat shall be in accordance with the
    manufacturer's recommendation, or on the basis of a trial application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the requirements of Clause 503.07(g) an evaporative
    retarding compound shall be used for the base and subbase concrete in
    accordance with the requirements of Clause 503.18(b).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For the base course no traffic or construction equipment other than that
    associated with testing, saw cutting and joint sealing shall be allowed on
    the finished base concrete until the in situ strength of the concrete is at
    least 60% of the target 28 day compressive strength. Notwithstanding the
    above, any damage caused to the base by the Contractor's operations shall
    be rectified by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For the subbase course the curing membrane shall be maintained until the
    base concrete is placed and any damage to the curing membrane during that
    time shall be repaired. No traffic or construction equipment shall be
    allowed on the finished concrete until the in situ strength of the subbase
    is at least 4 MPa. Any damage caused to the subbase by the Contractor's
    operations shall be rectified by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall take necessary measures to ensure that the temperature
    of the concrete does not fall below 5&#176;C during the first 24 hours
    after placing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing compounds shall not be applied to concrete surfaces which are to be
    subsequently asphalted, unless they are compatible with the asphalt layer
    or surfacing system or provision is made for removal of the compound from
    these surfaces prior to the application of the asphalt layer or surfacing
    system.

<p>
    (b) Application of Evaporative Retarding Compound
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The evaporative retarding compound, when required, is to be applied
    immediately after initial screeding. The remaining finishing operations can
    be carried out after application of the compound.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Application of the evaporative retarding compound shall be implemented in
    accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
