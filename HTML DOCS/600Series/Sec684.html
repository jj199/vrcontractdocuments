    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sprayed concrete:</strong>
    mortar or concrete pneumatically projected from a nozzle (sprayed) at high
    velocity onto a receiving surface where the sprayed material undergoes
    simultaneous placement and compaction to produce a dense homogeneous mass.
    As with conventional concrete the properties of sprayed concrete can be
    modified and further enhanced through the addition of additives or
    admixtures, such as silica fume, air-entraining admixtures, fibers and
    accelerators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Wet process application (i.e. shotcrete):</strong>
    the technique where the pre-mixed concrete or cementitious mortar is pumped
    down a hose to the exit nozzle, where compressed air is introduced via a
    separate hose to continuously propel the mix onto the prepared substrate.
    Any conventional concrete mix which is designed as a pump mix can generally
    be placed with the wet process.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dry process application (i.e. gunite):</strong>
    the technique where a dry mixture of cement, additives and aggregates or
    bagged pre-mixed proprietary formulated mortar is conveyed to a nozzle,
    where mixing with pressurised water occurs to produce the suitable
    consistency for the concrete to stick to the sprayed surface without
    slumping or rebounding excessively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rebound:</strong>
    part of the sprayed concrete which having struck the receiving surface does
    not adhere and deposits onto the ground or adjacent surfaces as wastage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Overspray:</strong>
    material outside the intended receiving surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sloughing/sagging:</strong>
    subsidence of the freshly applied sprayed concrete from its initial point
    of projection on the receiving surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Layer:</strong>
    the thickness of sprayed concrete built up from a number of passes of the
    nozzle over the working area.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Nozzle:</strong>
    the equipment consisting of a pipe with a mixing unit into which the
    various constituents are introduced and fitted at the end of the delivery
    hose from which the sprayed concrete is projected onto the receiving
    surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Nozzle operator:</strong>
    the person controlling the nozzle and the application of the sprayed
    concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Aspect ratio:</strong>
    the length of a fibre divided by its diameter.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Concrete cover:</strong>
    distance between the outside of the reinforcing steel and the nearest
    permanent surface of the sprayed concrete, or between the outside of the
    reinforcement and the nearest point on the receiving surface.

<p>
    Two test panels 750 mm x 750 mm and the greater of the specified thickness
    or 150 mm shall be constructed by the Contractor for each nominated nozzle
    operator prior to commencing full scale Works, for the purpose of checking
    the suitability of the proposed mix design, materials, plant and equipment,
    the method of working and the competence of the operator intended for the
    Works.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test panels shall be representative of the spraying operation(s) to be
    adopted, the in situ material(s), the location and the actual orientation
    (i.e. vertical, overhead etc.) of the sprayed concrete member at the Works.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Spraying of concrete into the test panels when placed horizontally on the
    ground shall not be allowed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Additional panels will be required if the Contractor should change the mix
    design, plant and equipment or operator. The test panels shall be stored
    and cured under similar conditions to the sprayed concrete placed in the
    Works and in accordance with the requirements of this specification.
    <p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall cut a sample of 8 cores from each test panel, at right
    angles to the plane of the panel approximately 48 hours after the panel has
    been sprayed. Cores shall not be taken within 125 mm of the edges of the
    panel.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that 2 of the cores per sample are cut from

</p>
<p>
    (a) Sampling and Testing of Pre-Mixed Concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete supplied for the Works shall be sampled at the worksite and
    tested for compliance with Section 610. In addition, sampling and testing
    to determine fibre content shall be as stated in Clause 684.08(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Sampling - General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sprayed concrete from the test panels and the finished Works shall be
    sampled and tested by taking 75 mm diameter cores to confirm compliance
    with the required compressive strength, 28 day volume of permeable voids
    (VPV) values, thickness and visual verification of quality. Cores shall not
    contain reinforcing bars.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The cores shall be cored through the whole thickness of the sprayed
    concrete and visually inspected to verify that the sprayed concrete is
    dense and homogeneous without segregation of aggregate and/or fibre or
    other visible imperfections as described in Clause 684.15.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should any of the cores reveal defects such as lack of compaction, dry
    patches, voids or sand pockets, the Superintendent may require further
    tests or cores from the sprayed concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Core holes in finished Works shall be cleaned and repaired with a single
    component, shrinkage compensating proprietary cementitious material in
    accordance with Section 689. The exposed surface of the repaired hole shall
    be identical in texture and colour to the surrounding finished work
    concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The cores shall be secured, stored, cured and tested in accordance with AS
    1012. All cores shall be clearly labelled to identify them with the
    location they represent. The strength and VPV requirements shall be in
    accordance with Section 610 and as detailed on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the length of core from finished Works is less than 150 mm, core
    strengths shall be corrected in accordance with the correction factors
    given in AS 1012.14.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Coring from the Works shall not be undertaken unless steel reinforcement
    has been located either by prior knowledge of its exact location or by use
    of a calibrated cover meter supplemented by reference to the drawings. The
    location of the steel shall be clearly marked upon the surface of the
    concrete to ensure the accuracy of the coring activity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For concrete repair and CP overlay Works completed with proprietary spray
    applied cementitious mortars, compliance with the required compressive
    strength and 28 day VPV values shall be confirmed by the sampling and
    testing of cores from production test panels as specified in Clause
    684.07(c). Sampling and testing of cores for compressive strength and 28
    day VPV values from the finished concrete repair and CP overlay works is
    not required.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Sampling and Testing for Fibre Content
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Further to the requirements of Clause 610.16(a) for sampling and testing of
    concrete, the fibre content shall be determined in accordance with the
    VicRoads fibre wash-out test method RC 377.01 and assessed for compliance
    in accordance with Clause 684.05 by sampling at a frequency of one test per
    five batch loads of concrete. The concrete represented by the sample shall
    be deemed to comply if the fibre content as determined is within 1% of the
    fibre content in the approved mix design.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The worksheet and/or report for determination of fibre content shall be
        submitted for review by the Superintendent.

    (d) Sampling Frequency of Completed Structural Work
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall sample each day's production, from production lots
    established to meet the requirements of Table 684.081. Each production lot
    shall consist of 6 cores, taken at locations which shall be representative
    of the work completed in a day's spraying operation. The actual core sites
    shall be selected in accordance with VicRoads Test Method RC 316.10, except
    that areas within 200 mm of the edges of construction and within one (1)
    metre of a lateral construction joint shall be excluded from the lot.

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Equipment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The equipment used shall have adequate capacity and be capable of
    delivering the concrete constituents to the nozzle at a uniform rate such
    that the sprayed concrete leaves the nozzle in a continuous uninterrupted
    stream and at a velocity of discharge which will maximise compaction,
    minimise rebound and overspray and prevent sagging of the applied concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Equipment shall be capable of allowing the nozzle to be maintained
    perpendicular and at a distance of less than 1 m from the receiving
    surface, and except where necessary at the required angle which will
    produce a dense in situ concrete with maximum adherence of material onto
    the prepared substrate. Delivery hoses shall have an internal diameter for
    unimpeded flow of material without blockages, balling of fibre or
    segregation of aggregate and/or fibre.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Chemical admixture dispensing equipment and meters shall be subject to
    regular maintenance and calibrated at three monthly intervals.

    preparation of the substrate as specified in Clause 684.09.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The finished sprayed concrete shall be dense and homogeneous for its full
    thickness, without segregation of aggregate or fibres, and without
    collapsing, excessive rebound or other visible imperfections.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each layer of the sprayed concrete shall be built up by making several
    passes over the working area. During starting and stopping of the spraying
    operation or whenever flow becomes intermittent or irregular for any cause
    the nozzle operator shall direct the nozzle away from the work until it
    again becomes constant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a layer of sprayed concrete is to be covered by succeeding layers, it
    shall be allowed to set prior to application of the succeeding layer. The
    surface shall be checked for soundness, segregated, loose or otherwise
    uncompacted sprayed concrete removed, repaired as specified, cleaned, and
    wetted using a blast of air and water.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For vertical and near vertical surfaces application shall commence at the
    bottom. For overhead surfaces sprayed concrete shall be applied from the
    shoulder to the crown.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Layer thickness shall be limited to a maximum of 150 mm to ensure that the
    material does not sag or delaminate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The spray nozzle shall be held at such a distance and angle to ensure
    placement of concrete behind and around steel reinforcement before any
    concrete is allowed to accumulate on its front face. Sprayed concrete shall
    not be placed through more than one layer of steel fabric, reinforcing bars
    or titanium anode mesh in one application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
