<p>
    (a) Strength and Age
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The post&#8209;tensioning force shall not be applied to a member until it
    has attained the compressive strength stated herein or on the drawings, nor
    shall it be applied at an earlier age than seven days after casting when

    provided that in the latter case the temperature of the member has returned
    to normal.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Consideration will be given to the application of stage stressing at an
    earlier date to overcome handling or shrinkage problems, or to permit early
    removal of temporary supports (falsework). Details of proposals shall be
    submitted to the Superintendent for review.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        At least one week prior to the start of post&#8209;tensioning the

</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the measured length of the tendon between the faces of anchorage
    plates
    <p>

    Where tendons are to be jacked initially from one end only, the
    calculations shall provide details of the predicted extensions at both ends
    of the member.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The applied tensioning force shall be determined by direct measurement of
    the jacking force at the gauge and shall be checked by measurement of the
    elongation of the tendon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The actual elongation(s) of the tendon shall lie between the calculated
    elongation(s) corresponding to the upper and lower limit of the tendon

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall give the Superintendent a minimum of seven days
        notice of each stressing operation.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        All stressing operations shall take place in the presence of the
        Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendon ducts and anchorages shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to
    commencement of tensioning. The protruding ends of tendons shall be cleaned
    in order to remove deposits of oil, rust, mortar or soil, which would
    lessen the grip of wedges or of anchorage devices.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendons shall be checked before tensioning to ensure that they are free to
    move inside the duct.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The jacks shall be set accurately in the line of the tendons.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The stressing operation shall be performed by suitably trained and
    experienced personnel who are familiar with the approved system using the
    best available practices in accordance with the manufacturer's advice.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The stressing force shall be applied smoothly and evenly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sequence of stressing shall be as shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No member shall be left partly stressed unless the drawings require the
    member to be stressed in stages.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The force which is applied initially to take up the slack of the tendon
    shall be sufficient to seat the jack firmly but shall not exceed the amount
    normally associated with the particular method of prestressing. After
    taking up the slack, the tendon shall be accurately marked at both ends and
    the elongation or draw&#8209;in shall be measured in relation to these
    marks. Readings of force and elongation shall be taken at regular intervals
    during the tensioning of a tendon. The elongation readings shall be plotted
    in order to determine the zero error and a correction for the zero error
    shall then be made to the final elongation. Where tendons consist of a
    number of individual components each component shall be marked so that any
    slip may be observed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where one or more components or tendons of a group stressed together slips
    during stressing operations, the Superintendent may permit a compensating
    increase in the elongation of the remaining tendons of the group provided
    that the jacking force does not exceed 85% of the minimum ultimate tensile
    strength of the remaining tendons.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In the case of a tendon breaking or slipping after tensioning, so that the
    allowable tolerances above are exceeded, the tendon shall be released,
    replaced if necessary, and re&#8209;stressed. Under no circumstances shall
    the maximum jacking force exceed the rated capacity of the jacking
    equipment or 85% of the specified minimum ultimate strength of the tendon,
    whichever is the lesser.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Allowance shall be made for draw&#8209;in of the tendon at the anchored end
    and where tendons are coupled, allowance shall be made for draw&#8209;in or
    movement at the coupling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendons shall be marked to allow measurement of elongation at both the
    jacking end and, where possible, at the anchored end.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Friction losses shall be measured.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On completion of stressing, wedges shall be seated and the stressing force
    shall be released gradually.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Subject to the above, tendons may be tensioned by one of the following
    methods.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Tensioning with One Jack
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Short tendons with low friction losses may be tensioned with a single jack.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Tensioning with Two Jacks
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Longer tendons in which friction losses are significant may be tensioned
    from both ends of the tendon, either simultaneously or sequentially.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Tensioning Simultaneously from Both Ends
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tensioning shall continue until the required force in the tendon is
    reached. The extensions at the two jacks need not be the same but the sum
    of the elongations should equal the predicted total elongation subject to
    the provisions of Clause 612.15.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Tensioning Initially from One End (Sequentially)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Jacks shall be positioned at both ends of the tendon. The trailing jack
    shall be set so that the force transmitted to it can be recorded. Stressing
    shall commence at the leading jack and shall continue until the force at
    this end is approximately 75%* of the required tendon force. The force at
    the trailing jack shall then be increased until the force in the leading
    jack is reached. Stressing shall then continue simultaneously at both jacks
    until the required force in the tendon is reached. The extensions at the
    two jacks need not be the same but the sum of the elongations should equal
    the predicted total elongation subject to the provisions of Clause 612.15.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    * The designer may, in consultation with the Contractor and the supplier of
    the pre-stressing system, vary the level of the initial jacking force at
    the leading end provided that the required final jacking force is achieved.
    <p>

    During this period the crest vents shall be opened after five minutes to
    allow removal of bleed water or air that may have accumulated in the vent.
    This process shall be repeated after ten minutes after which the inlet
    shall be closed to maintain the pressure in the duct.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All vents and the ends of the duct shall remain closed until the grout has
    set.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the pressure in the duct cannot be maintained at 0.7 MPa, grouting shall
    be suspended, the duct flushed clean with water and the leakage sealed
    before grouting is resumed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If a blockage occurs, pumping may be transferred to the far end of the duct
    provided that thus is done in sufficient time for the grout to remain
    workable and there are enough vents to ensure that the duct will be filled
    with grout. Alternatively, duct may be flushed with clean water to clear
    the blockage and the grouting repeated. If a second blockage occurs, the
    grout mix will be rejected and the Contractor will be required to revise
    the grout mix design.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All duct openings shall be inspected at between two and three days after
    grouting and topped up if required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    On completion of grouting and after the grout has hardened sufficiently,
    vents or grouting tubes that extend to the surface of the concrete shall be
    cut off 25 mm below the concrete surface and the recess filled with a
    proprietary concrete repair mortar.

            An alternative method for grouting of tendon ducts in pre-cast
            post-tensioned beams
            <p>
            </p>
        </em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        To ensure that the tendon duct is completely filled with grout and that
        there are no voids containing air or bleed-water in the grout, the
        above procedure may not be sufficient.
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Although this method is of greatest benefit for beams with tendons
        having a curving profile, it may also offer significant benefits for
        beams with straight tendons.
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        The beam shall be raised at one end to a point where the gradient of
        the curving duct is always positive. The end of the beam shall be
        lifted by the embedded lifting attachments with the use of a crane. The
        beam shall be lifted and supported in such a way that no damage occurs
        to the concrete and that none of its components are overstressed. After
        lifting the beam, it shall be supported on a rigid and stable support
        designed to prevent collapse or toppling.
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Grouting of the duct shall then be conducted as described above,
        working from the low end of the beam.
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        When the grout has achieved sufficient strength, the beam shall be
        returned to its normal storage position taking the same precautions as
        described for lifting and with the same equipment.
        <p>
        </p>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>
        Non-destructive testing shall be used to prove the absence of voids at
        the request of the Superintendent.

    612.21 CONCRETING OF ANCHORAGE RECESSES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Filling of recesses at anchorages shall be as shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When the grouting has been completed and the grout has set, the protruding
    ends of tendons shall be cut back sufficiently to ensure a minimum of 30 mm
    cover to the ends of the tendons when concreting of the recesses has been
    completed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Flame cutting of the protruding ends of strands or tendons is not
    permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The interior surfaces of anchorage recesses shall be scabbled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement shall be placed in the recesses as shown on the
    drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface of the recess shall be coated with a bonding agent after which
    concrete, conforming to the requirements of Section 610 , shall be cast in
    the recesses to the shape required by the drawings.
