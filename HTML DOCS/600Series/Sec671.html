    671.03 CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF BRIDGE BARRIERS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cast&#8209;in&#8209;place concrete barriers and precast concrete barrier
    units shall be constructed and installed as shown on the contract drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cast&#8209;in&#8209;place concrete for barriers shall be constructed in
    accordance with Section 610, and to the requirements of this section. Steel
    reinforcement for cast&#8209;in&#8209;place concrete shall comply with
    Section 611.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete deck surfaces in contact with cast&#8209;in&#8209;place portions
    of the concrete barriers shall be treated as a construction joint in
    accordance with Clause 610.20. Cast&#8209;in&#8209;place concrete or
    precast concrete bridge barrier units shall not be placed before the
    corresponding deck concrete achieves the 7&#8209;day compressive strength
    corresponding to the concrete grade in Table 610.051. Barriers on
    cast&#8209;in&#8209;place post&#8209;tensioned concrete superstructures
    shall not be installed or cast until all prestressing operations have been
    completed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All barrier surfaces including the precast units, where required, and the
    cast&#8209;in&#8209;place concrete shall have a Class 3 surface finish as
    specified in Section 610.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Installation of precast concrete barrier units shall comply with the
    tolerances specified in Section 610 prior to construction of the
    cast&#8209;in&#8209;place sections of the barriers. The sloping portion of
    the cast&#8209;in&#8209;place section of the precast concrete barriers
    shall be partially formed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Three millimetre diameter galvanized wires or synthetic cords shall be
    threaded through each service duct in the concrete barrier and shall be
    continuous for the full length of the bridge.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cast&#8209;in&#8209;place concrete barriers and stitch pours shall not be
    subjected to vibration from adjacent construction operations for a minimum
    period of 24 hours following completion of the associated concrete pour.

    671.04 INSTALLATION OF STEEL POSTS AND RAILS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All barrier posts shall be vertical.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Panels of posts and rails shall have a smooth even alignment both
    vertically and horizontally which shall be free from any steps or
    imperfections that could cause a vehicle to snag on the barrier.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolts, nuts, washers, base plates and welds shall be of the correct sizes
    and shall be assembled in accordance with the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sleeves at expansion joints shall be connected to the rail on the lower
    side of the joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolted joints at sleeves joints and rail splices shall be as shown on the
    drawings and as specified. Hole drilling shall be in accordance with
    Section 630 and any cut surfaces (holes) shall have a protective coating
    treatment applied in accordance with Section 631.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After the barrier has been installed and all connections made, the gap
    between the base plate and the top of concrete footing shall be completely
    filled with a flowable dual shrinkage compensating proprietary cementitious
    grout in accordance with Clause 610.32. Dry pack mortar shall not be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Railing posts shall not be grouted until the Contractor provides a
        Survey Certificate verifying compliance with the specified tolerances
        on lines and levels.
        <p>
        </p>

    671.05 STEEL POST AND RAIL FINISH
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Requirements for protective coating finishes for steel components shall be
    as shown on the drawings. The finished surface of posts and rails shall be
    smooth, non&#8209;abrasive and non&#8209;snagging.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Both internal and external surfaces of barrier railing and posts shall have
    a hot-dip galvanized (zinc) coating applied in accordance with AS/NZS 4680.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the barrier is completely sealed by welding against the ingress of
    water and other corrosive agents, a zinc silicate primer may be applied for
    external protection in lieu of galvanizing. The primer shall be applied in
    accordance with Section 631.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required, additional paint finishes for secondary protective coatings
    or aesthetic and other reasons shall be applied in accordance with Section
