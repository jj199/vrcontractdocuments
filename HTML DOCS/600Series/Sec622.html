    Wires and strands which are heavily corroded or visibly pitted will not be
    accepted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Slight surface rusting shall not be a reason for rejection provided that no
    pitting is visible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Wire and strand shall be kept free from loose rust, oil, grease, tar,
    paint, soil or any other harmful substances.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the wire or strand become contaminated with any substance, it shall be
    cleaned with suitable equipment and appropriate detergents and/or clean
    water until all of the contaminant and any detergent has been removed to
    the satisfaction of the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Loose rust shall be removed by mechanical or manual methods that do not
    cause damage to the wire or strand or which impair the bond between the
    wire or strand and the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Wire or strand that remains contaminated or that has suffered damage or
    impairment during cleaning will not be accepted.
    <p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    622.04 PLACING TENDONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendons shall be placed in continuous lengths in the positions shown on the
    drawings and shall be held in the required position by end-blocks of
    sufficient strength and stiffness to safely maintain the required force in
    the tendons.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendons shall be debonded in the positions shown on the drawings by the use
    of close-fitting plastic tubing which shall be sealed to prevent grout
    leakage into the tube. Grease or other coatings shall not be used for
    debonding.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendons shall not be allowed to come into contact with the oiled surface of
    the formwork. If a tendon is contaminated with oil or other harmful
    substance it shall be cleaned using an appropriate method in order to
    ensure that the bond between the tendon and the concrete is unimpaired.
    Tendons that cannot be cleaned shall be replaced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendons shall not be welded or exposed to heat from welding or other
    sources.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where deflected tendons are shown on the drawings, tendons shall be
    restrained with devices of sufficient strength to hold the tendons in their
    proper positions without displacement during the placing and compaction of
    concrete.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    622.05 STRESSING PRECAUTIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stressing of tendons, measurement of elongation and associated operations
    shall be conducted in a safe manner. The pre-cast concrete manufacturer
    shall comply with the requirement of the Occupational Health and Safety Act
    to provide a safe workplace.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The stressing jack shall be adequately supported and restrained in order to
    ensure that it cannot cause injury to personnel operating the jacking
    equipment should the jack lose its grip on the tendons or should the tendon
    fail.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No-one shall stand behind the jack or in a position where a broken tendon
    could cause injury when stressing is in progress.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should a tendon break during stressing, adequate restraint shall be
    provided to prevent lateral or vertical movement of the broken tendon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Robust barriers shall be provided in order to prevent a broken or loose
    tendon from recoiling into the working area.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Warning signs that conform to AS 1319 - Safety signs for the occupational
    environment - shall be displayed at both ends of the member being tensioned
    during stressing operations.

    622.06 TENSIONING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Equipment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall maintain current calibration certificates
        conforming to the requirements of AS 2193 Grade B for the jack and
        pressure gauges or other force measuring devices. Jacks and pressure
        gauges and other devices shall be used as a single unit, which shall be
        calibrated to AS 2193, at the appropriate force range. The calibration
        or test certificates shall be endorsed in accordance with the AS
        ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for the calibration laboratory.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The power unit shall be adjusted so that the rate of extension of the
    tendon is within the specified limits. The measuring equipment shall permit
    measurement of the tendon force prior to lock-off to the degree of accuracy
    required by AS 2193 Grade B. The measuring equipment used shall permit
    elongation to be determined to an accuracy of &#177;2%. The equipment shall
    prevent unwinding of the strand during tensioning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sag take-up force in the tendons shall be measured with equipment which
    complies with the repeatability and accuracy requirements of AS 2193 Grade
    B, at a scale mark at which the equipment has been calibrated. The
    readability requirements of AS 2193 Grade B shall be ignored for the
    purpose of establishing sag take-up. Sag take-up force shall not exceed 20%
    of the required tendon force, and shall be not less than 10% of the
    required tendon force or 10% of gauge capacity, whichever is the greater.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Anchorages
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Anchorages shall be of a type that prevents the occurrence of slip during
    casting and curing operations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Tendon Force
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Before tensioning commences, the Contractor shall calculate the extension
    corresponding to the required tendon force shown on the drawings. The
    calculation shall be based on the measured length of the tendon between the
    tendon anchorages at the end blocks and the modulus of elasticity
    determined from the sample tested in accordance with Clause 622.02.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The calculations shall include allowances for all losses including slip at
    anchorages, elastic shortening of the stressing bed, pull-in on transfer of
    prestress, friction losses and temperature changes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The calculations shall be reviewed by the designer of the pre-tensioned
    concrete units who shall certify that the calculations meet the
    requirements of the specification and the drawings. The Contractor shall
    provide a copy of the designer's certification to the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After all tendons have been anchored to the end-blocks (locked&#8209;off),
    the force remaining in the tendons at mid-span of the unit shall be the
    required tendon force stated on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The allowable variation of the tendon force shall be &#177;2%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Under no circumstances shall the maximum tensioning force exceed the lesser
    of the rated capacity of the jacking equipment or 80% of the tensile
    strength of the tendon.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The tensioning force required to achieve the design tendon force shall be
    determined from the calibration certificate and the actual elongation of
    the tendon corresponding to the tensioning force shall be recorded.
    Alternatively, the Superintendent may approve determination of the
    tensioning force by measurement of the elongation, provided that the limits
    of variation of the modulus of elasticity of the tendons are satisfactory.
    In this case, the jacking force shall be recorded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should the modulus of elasticity of batches of tendons differ by more than
    3%, the required elongation shall be adjusted accordingly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Where the difference between the force determined from the calibration
        certificate and the tensioning force calculated from the elongation
        exceeds 4%, the Contractor shall nominate some or all of the following
        remedial steps subject to review by the Superintendent. The Contractor
        shall suspend stressing until the completion of the Superintendent's
        review:
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; re&#8209;calibration of tensioning equipment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; testing of tendon material to check the modulus of elasticity
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; that tendons be released and restressed (with the adoption of a
    modulus of elasticity applicable to the second stressing)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; other steps as agreed by the Superintendent.
    <p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Tensioning Procedure
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall give the Superintendent seven days notice of
        stressing operations.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        All stressing operations shall take place in the presence of the
        Contractor's Precast Concrete Surveillance Officer.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tensioning operations shall be performed by suitably trained and
    experienced personnel.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the sag take-up force is not measured, the slack shall be taken up by
    means of a pulling device pre&#8209;set to the sag take-up force. An
    allowance (based on elongation measurements) shall be made for sag take-up
    force in calculating the tensioning force. Tendons shall be marked for
    measurement of elongation after this sag take-up force has been applied. In
    order that slip may be observed, each tendon shall be marked at both the
    jacking end and the dead end of the stressing bed prior to the commencement
    of tensioning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should slip occur in any one of a group of tendons being tensioned
    together, provided that not more than two tendons have slipped, tensioning
    of the group including the slipped tendons may be completed. If more than
    two tendons have slipped, the whole of the group shall be relaxed, the
    tendons shall be re&#8209;set and the whole group tensioned again.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The prestressing force shall be transferred from the tensioning jack to the
    stressing-bed end-block immediately after the required tendon force prior
    to lock-off (or the required elongation) has been reached in the tendons.
    The hydraulic pressure in the jack shall then be relaxed before any other
    operation is commenced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Action if Concreting is Delayed
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If placing of concrete does not commence within 24 hours of completion of
    tensioning of the tendons, the Contractor shall re-establish the jacking
    equipment and check the force in each of the tendons. If the measured force
    in any of the tendons is less than the required tendon force, the tendon
    stressing procedure shall be repeated. Placing of concrete may commence on
    completion of checking of tendon forces and re-tensioning (if required).

    622.08 TRANSFER OF PRESTRESS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall submit details of the proposed method of transfer
        of prestress to the Superintendent for review not less than 14 days
        prior to the commencement of tensioning.
        <p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Procedure
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Transfer of prestress shall not take place:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; until the concrete has reached the transfer strength stated on the
    drawings or in the specification; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; before the steam covers have been removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to transfer of the prestressing force to the units all tendons shall
    be:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; tested for tightness; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; marked at each end of the unit to enable pull&#8209;in of the
    tendons to be measured.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Tendon pull-in shall be recorded and the record shall be supplied to the
    Superintendent on completion of the unit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Transfer shall be gradual, continuous and simultaneous from each end of the
    unit, and shall be performed in the shortest practicable time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Transfer by cutting of tendons that are still under tension is not
    permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If it is proposed to transfer prestress by applying heat, the Contractor
    shall submit details of the method of transfer of prestress to the
    Superintendent, including:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) the lengths of free tendons between units and at both ends of the bed
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) the locations where the heat will be applied
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the order of severance of tendons and of release of devices for
    deflecting tendons
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) the method of applying heat and the proposed equipment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Heat shall be applied over a portion of the exposed tendon and for a period
    of time sufficient to ensure that the tendon is entirely relaxed before it
    is severed. Care shall be taken to prevent heat-damage to the concrete.
    Heat shall not be applied directly to any part of any tendon within 100 mm
    of the concrete surface of the units.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, on completion of the transfer of prestress the
    projecting lengths of tendons shall be cut-off flush with the end of the
    unit using a mechanical cutter. Care shall be taken to avoid damage to the
    concrete surface. Should damage to the concrete surfaces around the tendon
    anchorages occur during cutting, the Contractor shall submit proposals for
    its repair to the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Pull-in of Tendons
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The maximum pull&#8209;in of any tendon shall not exceed 6 mm. If
    pull&#8209;in exceeds 6 mm, the degree of variation shall be recorded and
    the cause shall be investigated by the Contractor and the results shall be
    submitted to the Superintendent for review.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the unit does not meet strength and serviceability requirements of the
    design, it shall be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Hog
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Hog shall be measured at mid-span of the unit immediately after transfer of
    prestress has been completed. The actual hog shall be compared to the
    anticipated hog and to the hogs of other units intended for the same
    structure. If the hog varies by more than &#177; 25% from the anticipated
    hog, the effects of this variation shall be investigated by the Contractor
    and the results shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the unit does not meet strength and serviceability requirements of the
    design or if the geometrical variation between adjacent units is
    unacceptable, it shall be rejected. Unacceptable geometrical variation is
    defined as a difference in the levels of groups of units or between
    adjacent units that requires a change in grade-line to accommodate the
    variation allowing for the required thickness of asphalt surfacing.

    622.10 PROTECTION OF EXPOSED ENDS OF TENDONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the end face of the unit and the tendons are to be cast into a
    diaphragm, the concrete surface surrounding the ends of the tendons and the
