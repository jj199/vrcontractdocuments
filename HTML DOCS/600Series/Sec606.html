<p>
    Temporary pile casings shall be used unless the Contractor can demonstrate
    to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that an alternative construction
    method without casing will achieve the specified pile dimensional
    tolerances and cover to the steel reinforcement and that the durability and
    strength of the finished concrete will not be impaired by inclusions of
    foreign material or voids. The Contractor may be required to carry out any
    tests that are reasonably requested by the Superintendent to demonstrate
    compliance with these requirements. The cost of such testing shall be borne
    by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All excavated material shall be removed from the site and disposed of as
    soon as practicable, so that the site of the works is kept in a clean and
    tidy condition.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The type and thickness of the steel plate used in the temporary casing
    shall be selected by the Contractor who shall be fully responsible for its
    structural adequacy. The type and thickness of the temporary casings
    include providing safe access for personnel, resisting all superimposed
    loads from driving, extraction, earth and water pressures and the effects
    of any distortion which is likely to occur to the casing shall be
    proof-engineered by a Proof-Engineer who is pre-qualified in accordance
    with the VicRoads scheme for pre-qualification.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall notify the Superintendent for inspection of the pile
    excavation by the Superintendent. A minimum of 48 hours notice shall be
    given to the Superintendent for arrangement of the inspection. Prior to
    inspection, the pile excavation shall be de&#8209;watered and the walls and
    base of the pile cleaned out, including the internal surface of the casing,
    to remove all mud, loose or foreign material.
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete used for the construction of bored piles shall comply with the
    requirements of Section 610.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement shall comply with the requirements of Section 611.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Further to the requirements of Clause 611.10 spacers and supports for bored
    pile steel reinforcement shall be placed at intervals of no more than 2 m
    along the full length of the steel reinforcement cage to ensure that the
    specified concrete cover to the steel reinforcement is maintained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete placed in the dry shall be either self compacting concrete (SCC)
    or highly workable concrete in accordance with the requirements of Clause
    610.07, Clause 610.13 and Clause 610.18(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where highly workable concrete is placed in the dry, it shall be compacted
    with immersion type, high frequency vibrators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be placed through a tremie tube and shall not be dropped
    from a height greater than 2 m through air. Concrete which is being
    discharged from a tremie shall be positively guided away from the pile
    reinforcement so that segregation is not caused by the flow of concrete
    impinging on the reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alternative methods for placing concrete in the dry from those specified in
    this clause may be used subject to a review by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The casing shall be withdrawn with care during casting of the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Care shall be taken to prevent soil and rock dislodging from the side of
    the hole and contaminating the concrete forming the minimum cover to the
    reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum height of concrete within the casing shall be adjusted to
    ensure that water is not permitted to enter from outside the casing, and
    that the soil pressure at the toe of the casing is balanced by the mass of
    the concrete within the casing. The free surface of the concrete shall be
    at least 1.5 m above the bottom of the casing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If after driving the casing, it is found not possible to seal the excavated
    pile from the inflow of water, mud, loose rock or similar materials, the
    reinforcement and concrete may be placed under water, subject to a review
    by the Superintendent and the requirements of Clause 606.06(b).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        Reinforcement and/or concrete shall not be placed until the proposed
        method of removing mud, loose rock or similar materials, and the method
        of placement of concrete under water has been reviewed by the
        Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles shall be concreted within 24 hours of completion of the pile
    excavation. For delays greater than 24 hours, the Contractor shall ream the
    walls and the base of the pile to remove not less than 25 mm thickness of
    material, or any other foundation material which has softened in that time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles placed in the dry shall be constructed to a minimum of 300 mm above
    pile cut-off level to allow breaking back of contaminated concrete at the
    top of the pile.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Casting Under Water
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete placed under water shall be self compacting concrete (SCC) in
    accordance with the requirements of Clause 610.07, Clause 610.13 and Clause
    610.18(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be of such consistency, and shall be placed in such a
    manner that pockets of air or water or ground materials are not entrapped
    in the concrete, and the space between the reinforcement and the side walls
    of the hole are completely filled with compacted concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concreting using tremie methods shall not commence until the pile hole is
    filled with such head of water as to equalise the external water pressure
    from the surrounding ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a tremie is used, the hopper and pipe of the tremie shall be steel,
    smooth bore, clean and water tight throughout. The tremie pipe shall be
    sealed with a plate taped to its outlet, to prevent direct contact between
    the first discharge of concrete in the pipe of the tremie and the water.
    The tremie pipe shall extend to the base of the pile hole before the tremie
    is charged with concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a pump is used in lieu of a tremie, a sponge shall be inserted in the
    discharge line before the discharge hopper is loaded so that water and air
    in the line are prevented from mixing with the advanced column of fresh
    concrete. The end of the discharge hose shall be held against the bottom of
    the hole until the sponge is released. The whole operation shall be
    controlled to ensure that no voids are trapped in the pile concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concreting shall not commence until the tremie pipe or pump discharge hose
    are fully charged. The outlet of the tremie pipe or pump discharge hose
    shall not be lifted from the bottom of the hole until the hole has been
    filled with a minimum of 2 m depth of concrete. Thereafter, concreting
    shall be kept a minimum of 2 m below the top surface of the concrete at all
    times and the Contractor shall continuously monitor and ensure that the 2 m
    depth of embedment is to be maintained at all time. The rate of withdrawal
    of the tremie pipe or pump discharge hose during concreting shall be
    pre-determined by the Contractor based on the actual pile hole diameter and
    the volume of concrete pumped into the pile hole. The rate of withdrawal of
    the tremie pipe or pump discharge hose versus the volume of concrete placed
    shall be recorded by the Contractor and the records shall be submitted to
    the Superintended within 24 hours on completion of concreting of a pile.
    The method used for concrete placement shall be such that a continuous
    supply of concrete is available at the top of the tremie tube or pump
    hopper during the entire process of placing concrete. Concreting shall be
    continued until sound concrete appears a minimum of 400 mm above the
    required cut off level. The pile concrete shall not be cut back to its
    required level until a minimum of 24 hours after completion of placement of
    concrete.

    (b) Static Load Testing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out static load testing on bored and
    cast-in-place shown on the drawings. Static load testing such as
    compression test, tension test and lateral load test shall be undertaken in
    accordance with AS 2159.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Load testing shall not be carried out until the concrete achieves the
    specified 28 day compressive strength.

<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Dynamic Pile Testing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to Integrity Testing and Static Load Testing, the Contractor
    shall carry out dynamic testing of piles to confirm that design pile
    capacity has been achieved. At least one (1) load test shall be performed
    for every 10 piles or, one load test per pile cap or bridge abutment,
    whichever gives the greatest number of pile testing. Dynamic testing shall
    also be carried out on piles of which the pile toe levels vary by more than
    2 metres from the test pile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that a pile driving rig with adequate capacity
    to mobilise the test pile with a single blow is employed during Dynamic
    Pile Testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contractor intends to seek dispensation of pile testing, the
    Contractor shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that
    an appropriate geotechnical investigation(s) has been carried out at the
    piling location with relevant geotechnical information at least 5 m below
    the design pile toe level. The submission shall include a proof engineer's
    certificate to confirm that where the pile is expected to develop its
    capacity, the lowest bound value of material strength established from the
    investigation has been adopted, and that a maximum geotechnical strength
    reduction factor of 0.45 has been adopted in the Ultimate Limit State
    geotechnical strength design in accordance with AS 2159. This information
    shall be provided to the Superintendent for review at least 4 weeks prior
    to construction. No consideration for dispensation of pile testing shall be
    given during or after construction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The details of the proposed pile driving rig, hammer size and drop
        heights shall be provided to the Superintendent for review prior to
        undertaking the testing.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Testing shall be carried out by use of a Pile Driving Analyser (PDA) and
    the data obtained from each pile shall be analysed using CAPWAP, TNOWAVE or
    other approved equivalent software.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Reporting
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test procedure and test reports shall conform with the requirements of
    AS 2159, and two copies of a report showing the measured field parameters
    and the results of analysis to determine pile capacity shall be provided to
    the Superintendent. Where confirmation of pile capacity using dynamic pile
    testing is obtained by re&#8209;strike, the report shall include the
    results of the initial drive and all subsequent re&#8209;strike.

<p>
    (e) Acceptance Criterion
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The integrity testing shall demonstrate that the measured cross-sectional
    area of each test pile is not less than 5% of the corresponding pile shown
    on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where piles are subjected to static load testing, the following criterion
    shall be satisfied:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the plot of pile settlement with log time shall be linear or
    decreasing rate of creep, and the creep rate shall be less than 2 mm per
    log cycle of time at the test load;
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the maximum total pile settlement and lateral displacement at the
    design load shall not exceed the value shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test results are required to demonstrate meeting the acceptance
    criteria shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The measured ultimate capacity of test piles by dynamic testing shall be
    equal to or greater than the pile test load shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>

    606.08 TOLERANCES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The following tolerances shall apply to completed piles:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) pile head shall finish within 75 mm of the specified plan position;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) variation from the vertical or the specified batter/rake shall not be
    more than 1 in 100;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) where piling excavation has developed a curve or out of verticality,
    the offset from the theoretical straight pile line shall not exceed 150 mm
    over a length of 15 metres or proportionally for greater or shorter
    lengths.
