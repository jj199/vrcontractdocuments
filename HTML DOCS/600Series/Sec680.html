    680.03 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Anchor:</strong>
    a steel stud, threaded rod, steel bolt or reinforcing steel drilled and
    secured into the existing hardened concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bonded anchor:</strong>
    a system comprising an anchor and a chemical adhesive that transmits loads
    from the embedded anchor into the hardened concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Chemical adhesive:</strong>
    a material or bonding agent used to bond together steel and concrete
    components to hardened concrete and provide the pathway for the required
    load transfer of the bonded anchor system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Discrete population</strong>
    : A population of bonded anchors that has bonded anchors of the same type
    (manufacturer and model), installed in the same substrate (e.g. same type
    and strength, same installation conditions such as wet or dry and
    temperature) and have all been installed by the same work crew in the same
    shift.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Proof load test:</strong>
    A test performed on a bonded anchor whose installation is complete and is
    intended to validate correct installation, by allowing bond failure but
    precluding concrete failure via a confined test. The proof load shall not
    exceed the lesser of the yield strength of the anchor rod or the design
    bond strength of the chemical adhesive.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Ultimate load test:</strong>
    A test performed on a bonded anchor whose installation is complete and is
    intended to aid in establishing the suitability of the bonded anchor in a
    particular hardened concrete where all the properties required for design
    are not known, by allowing concrete failure and/or bond failure via an
    unconfined test.

</p>
<p>
    Bonded anchors shall be installed in the manner specified by the bonded
    anchor supplier by a competent person who has received appropriate training
    in accordance with Clause 680.06.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Holes for bonded anchors shall be drilled with carbide or diamond drill
    bits in accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions and
    shall be of the length and diameter specified by the supplier for the
    selected bonded anchor and as required by the design.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Holes for bonded anchors shall be positioned to avoid damage to
    reinforcement and pre-stressing tendons or to services. Prior to drilling
    of holes, reinforcing bars and pre-stressing cables that lie within the
    depth of the drill hole shall be accurately located by reference to
    as&#8209;constructed drawings. The actual position of bars and tendons
    shall then be located by use of a recently calibrated concrete cover meter,
    operated by a competent person. If reinforcement is encountered during
    drilling, drilling shall cease immediately and the Contractor (following
    consultation with the design engineer) shall provide the Superintendent
    with an acceptable course of action consistent with the design
    requirements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Holes for bonded anchors shall be drilled, roughened and cleaned in
    accordance with the manufacturer's installation instructions. However, as a
    minimum, the procedure for drilling and cleaning of holes shall be as
    follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) drill to required depth
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) air flush twice
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    (iii) brush clean twice
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) air flush twice
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (v) fingertip test the hole surface for dust, and if dust is still present,
    brush clean and air-flush until all dust is removed including a potential
    dust plug at the end of the hole which reduces embedment depth. At the end
    of the cleaning process, the hole shall be clean and free of debris, dust
    particles, oil and other contaminants over its full depth.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If a mechanical compressor is used to provide the air flush, the compressed
    air shall be free of oil.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The hole shall be filled with chemical adhesive and the anchor rod
    installed immediately following the cleaning process. If the hole
    <s>
    </s>
    is allowed to stand open for any period of time without installation, the
    cleaning process shall be repeated prior to installation of bonded anchors.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A discrete population of bonded anchors shall be installed by the same work
    crew.

    requirements specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Check temperature of hole prior to injecting chemical adhesive, note
    the working time which is the time allowed to place the anchor rod into the
    chemical adhesive and the curing time which is the time for the chemical to
    gain strength from the time of first mixing until the time when the bonded
    anchor can be loaded.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) The procedure for placing chemical adhesives and anchor rods shall be
    in accordance with the manufacturer's installation requirements.
    <p>
    </p>

    <a name="_Hlk528852775">S</a>
    eparate requirements are given below for suitability testing of bonded
    anchors based on ultimate load testing as defined in Clause 680.03 and for
    testing of bonded anchors based on proof load testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Test bonded anchors shall be installed by suitably competent and
    experienced personnel, as described in Clause 680.06 and in accordance with
    the requirements of Clause 680.08, in positions that are representative of
    the positions of the bonded anchors required by the design.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bonded anchors shall be tested using testing equipment that has been
    calibrated as a minimum, on an annual basis at the required intervals in
    accordance with AS 2193.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP One week prior to testing the Contractor shall submit to the
        Superintendent calibration certificates conforming to the requirements
        of AS 2193 Grade B for the jack and pressure gauges or other force

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Ultimate Load Testing for the suitability of bonded anchors
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless approved otherwise by the Superintendent, where the proposed bonded
    anchor system or where the characteristics of the substrate and/or
    installation are outside the scope of the bonded anchor prequalification as
    specified in Clause 680.05(a), the Contractor shall carry out ultimate load
    tests to validate the suitability of the bonded anchor system design and to
    demonstrate that the bonded anchor components, chemical adhesives, the
    substrate preparation and the proposed procedure will achieve the specified
    bonded anchor durability and load capacity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Ultimate load tests shall be conducted in advance of the installation of
    bonded anchors after the manufacturer's curing time has elapsed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bonded anchors to be tested for ultimate load shall be installed in an
    identical manner and shall be situated in a substrate identical to that of
    the anchors, and shall be positioned such that the installation and
    performance of the bonded anchors is not compromised in any way.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A sample consisting of at least five of the proposed total number of bonded
    anchors required by the design shall be subject to an ultimate load test.
    Ultimate load testing shall be conducted for each of the combinations of
    anchors and chemical adhesives in each type of concrete or other substrate
    material, in each orientation and in uncracked and, if present, cracked
    concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The testing personnel shall ensure that the bonded anchors are installed in
    accordance with the specification and the manufacturer's installation
    instructions. Testing personnel shall be suitably competent and possess the
    relevant experience at conducting testing of bonded anchors on site and
    reporting the findings including the different possible modes of failure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The mode of failure and corresponding ultimate load for each test shall be
    recorded in the test report. In the event that multiple failure modes are
    observed, testing shall continue until the required minimum number of
    dominant mode of failure results are achieved. The capacity of the bonded
    anchor shall be calculated from test results of the dominant mode of
    failure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bonded anchors shall be tested to the ultimate load certified by the design
    engineer for the bonded anchor used, in accordance with the requirements of
    ASTM E 488 and ASTM E 1512 or EOTA TR 048, based on the unconfined test
    method.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Proof Load Testing of bonded anchors
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bonded anchors that will be subject to tensile loads in service and
    whose failure could lead to failure or instability of a structure shall be
    subject to a proof load test.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For all other bonded anchors, a sample consisting of a minimum of 5 or 2.5%
    whichever is the greater, of the total number of bonded anchors shall be
    subject to a proof load test. For sampling and testing purposes each
    discrete population of bonded anchors shall be considered as a separate
    group and tested separately.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Proof load testing shall not occur prior to the completion of curing time
    stated in the manufacturer's installation instructions. The application of
    load shall occur smoothly with the proof load being achieved between one to
    three minutes from the commencement of loading. A bonded anchor shall be
    deemed to have failed a test if either visible displacement is detected at
    a load less than or equal to the test load, or if the anchor fails to
    achieve the required test load. If failure is encountered in any sample all
    anchors within the discrete area shall be proof load tested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bonded anchors shall be proof load tested to 1.5 x the maximum design load
    certified by the design engineer for the bonded anchor used in accordance
    with the requirements of either ASTM E 488 and ASTM E 1512 or EOTA TR 048,
    based on the confined test method.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bonded anchors in cracked concrete shall be proof load tested to 2 x the
    maximum design load certified by the design engineer for the bonded anchor
    used in accordance with the requirements of either ASTM E 488 and ASTM E
    1512 or EOTA TR 048, based on the confined test method.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The proof load shall be maintained for a minimum period of 60 seconds.
