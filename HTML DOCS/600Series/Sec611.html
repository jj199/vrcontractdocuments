    611.04 STEEL REINFORCEMENT SUPPLY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for the preparation of the steel
    reinforcement schedule for all steel reinforcement required for the
    Contract.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall make appropriate allowances when preparing the steel
    reinforcement schedule to achieve the specified tolerances on member
    dimensions, concrete cover and location of steel reinforcement and any
    post&#8209;tensioning sheathing or other fitments, taking into account the
    practical variations in the tolerances noted and other margins normally
    applied by steel reinforcement suppliers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement shall be supplied cut to length and bent to shape, as
    detailed on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface condition of reinforcement shall be such as to not impair its
    bond to the concrete or its performance in the member.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement shall not be coated unless specified, in which case the
    nature and type of the coating to be used and the conditions of application
    shall be separately specified. When carbon steel reinforcement is specified
    on the drawings to be hot-dip galvanised, the hot-dip galvanising shall be
    in accordance with AS 4680. Use of epoxy coated steel reinforcement shall
    not be permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stainless steel reinforcement shall be supplied, handled and stored
    separately from other steels. Tools used for cutting, bending and transport
    of stainless steel reinforcement shall not have been used for other
    materials.

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement shall be kept free from rust, oil, grease, tar, paint,
    mud or any other deleterious substance which may reduce bond between the
    steel reinforcement and concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The presence of mill scale or surface rust shall not be cause for rejection
    of reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement that has the surface pitted by corrosion, where the
    loss of cross-section is greater than the tolerance on mass per metre of
    bar (4.5%), shall not be used in the works.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stainless steel reinforcement shall be supplied, handled and stored

    All steel reinforcement shall be securely held during placing and
    compacting of the concrete. Steel reinforcement supports shall be made of
    durable materials strong enough to withstand the imposed loads without
    movement of the steel reinforcement, shall be positively attached to the
    steel reinforcement, and of such size as to maintain the specified cover.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Wooden supports, metal supports and plastic-coated metal supports which
    extend to the surface of the concrete shall not be used. Placing bars on
    layers of fresh concrete as the work progresses and adjusting bars during
    the placing of concrete will not be permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The specified minimum concrete cover shall be maintained at tie-wire
    positions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that the method of placement of stainless steel
    reinforcement does not allow it to become contaminated by contact with
    other steel. In particular, welding or cutting of black steel reinforcement
    or any other structural steel shall not occur after any stainless steel has
    been placed.
    <p>
    </p>
