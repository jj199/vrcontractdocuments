    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the supply of buried corrugated metal structures (BCMS)
    of the following types:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; bolted steel plates or sheets in accordance with AS/NZS 2041
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; long-span corrugated steel structures in accordance with AS/NZS
    2041.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Except as otherwise stated in Bridge Technical Note BTN 015 Buried
    Corrugated Metal Structures, all BCMS shall be designed and constructed in
    accordance with AS 2041:2011 the Australian Standard for Buried Corrugated
    Metal Structures.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All BCMS shall be provided with a reinforced concrete invert lining in
    accordance with Bridge Technical Note BTN 015 Buried Corrugated Metal
    Structures.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    BCMS made from continuous helically-wound galvanised steel strips with
    lock-seams or other proprietary helically-wound profiles are not permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    BCMS are not permitted if the culvert will be permanently inundated and
    water will be in constant contact with the galvanised steel structure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    BCMS shall have a design life of 100 years. At the end of the design life
    the structure shall have a residual thickness of steel with sufficient
    capacity to safely support the design dead and live loads current at the
    time of design in accordance with the relevant Australian Standard.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    BCMS of less than 1200 mm diameter are not permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the required design life cannot be achieved using steel,
    consideration must be given to the use of alternative materials for example
    aluminium or pre-cast concrete pipes and box culverts.
