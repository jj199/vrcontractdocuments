    656<a name="np656"></a>.01 GENERAL
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Elastomeric bearings shall comply with Section 652 read in conjunction with
    AS 5100 Bridge design - Part 4: Bearings and deck joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that the bearings function as designed, they shall be of the
    sizes and at the positions, orientations and levels stated on the drawings.
    <p>

<p>
    656.02 PREPARATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete pedestals for bearings shall be of the sizes and at the positions,
    orientations and levels stated on the drawings and shall extend a minimum
    of 25 mm beyond the edge of bearing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Pedestals shall have sufficient strength to transmit the forces, movements
    and rotations required by the design to the bridge sub-structure.
    Construction joints at the interface between pedestals and the
    bearing-shelf shall be recessed a minimum of 20 mm below the top surface of
    the cross-head or bearing shelf. If shown on the drawings, dowels shall be
    provided at the construction joints to transmit horizontal design loads.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete for pedestals shall comply with the requirements of Section 610
    and shall have a minimum age of 7 days before load is transferred to the
    bearings from the beams.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If horizontal loads are to be transmitted by friction alone, the concrete
    surface on which elastomeric bearings, pads and strips are to be placed
    shall have sufficient surface roughness to develop the friction required by
    the bearing design. A wood-float finish will generally satisfy this
    requirement.

    656.03 INSTALLATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If required on the drawings, dowels shall be provided to transmit
    horizontal design loads in accordance with AS 5100.4. Dowels shall have
    sufficient strength to satisfy the requirements of the design and shall be
    made from durable materials and be de&#8209;mountable to allow removal and
    replacement of the bearings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bearings shall be restrained from moving by the use of stainless-steel
    brackets attached to the bearing-shelf and the beam or diaphragm. Brackets
    shall not be directly connected to the bearing nor shall they prevent or
    interfere with its normal functioning. Brackets and their fasteners shall
    have sufficient strength to satisfy the requirements of the design and
    shall be made from durable materials be de-mountable to allow removal and
    replacement of the bearings. Care shall be taken during the installation of
    fasteners to prevent damage to the beams and other structural components
    and in particular to prestressing strands and reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If bearings are installed level and the bottom flange of the beam above is
    sloping in transverse, longitudinal or both directions, machined plates or
    other spacing devices shall be manufactured and installed between the top
    surface of the bearing and the underside of the beam in accordance with the
    geometrical and strength requirements of the design.

<p>
    656.04 POSITION AND ALIGNMENT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bearings and pads shall be level and square to the longitudinal axis of the
    beam.
