    670.02 MATERIALS AND FABRICATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Materials and fabrication of steel components shall be in accordance with
    Section 630.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Materials and fabrication of cast steel posts and sleeves shall be in
    accordance with Section 675.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the drawing requires the steel barrier posts to be cut before welding
    to the structure, the Contractor shall make an allowance (not exceeding 20
    mm) for packing or cutting the posts to allow for variation of camber.

    670.03 INSTALLATION OF BARRIERS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The barrier shall be installed in accordance with Section 630 and to the
    tolerances specified in Clause 670.05, to a smooth alignment both
    vertically and horizontally independent of any irregularities that may
    exist in the alignment of the deck.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Barrier posts, panels, balusters and openings shall be vertical.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolts, nuts, washers, base plates and welds shall be of the correct sizes
    and shall be correctly assembled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Retrofitted bonded anchors shall not be used in anchor-bolts for steel
    barriers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sleeves at expansion joints shall be connected to the rail on the lower
    side of the joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolted joints at sleeves joints and rail splices shall be as shown on the
    drawings and as specified. Hole drilling shall be in accordance with
    Section 630 and any cut surfaces (holes) shall have a protective coating
    treatment applied in accordance with Section 631.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After the barrier has been installed and all connections made, the gap
    between the base plate and the top of concrete footing shall be completely
    filled with a flowable dual shrinkage compensating proprietary cementitious
    grout in accordance with Clause 610.32. Dry pack mortar shall not be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Railing posts shall not be grouted until the Contractor provides a
        Survey Certificate verifying compliance with the specified tolerances
        on lines and levels.
    </strong>

    670.04 BARRIER FINISH
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The type and extent of the primary protective coating and additional paint
    finish shall be as shown on the contract drawings and as specified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The finished surface of barriers shall be smooth, non&#8209;abrasive and
    non&#8209;snagging.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Both internal and external surfaces of barrier railing and posts shall have
    a hot-dip galvanized (zinc) coating applied in accordance with AS/NZS 4680.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Where the barrier is completely sealed by welding against the ingress of
    water and other corrosive agents, a zinc silicate primer may be applied for
    external protection in lieu of galvanising. The primer shall be applied in
    accordance with Section 631.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required, additional paint finishes for secondary protective coatings
    or aesthetic and other reasons shall be applied in accordance with Section
