    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the construction of cylinders which comprise a circular
    pre-cast concrete open caisson together with a cast in situ plain or
    reinforced concrete core.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinders shall be limited to a maximum depth of 3 metres and shall have a
    minimum diameter of 1.5 metres.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    604.02 STANDARD
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Design and construction of cylinders shall comply with the requirements of
    the Australian Standard for Bridge design - Foundations and soil supporting
    structures as listed in Section 175. Where a cylinder footing has been
    designed in accordance with the Australian Standard for Piling - Design and
    installation as listed in Section 175, and design requirements differ
    between the two Australian Standards, the requirements of Bridge design -
    Foundations and soil supporting structures shall take precedence over those
    of the requirements of Piling - Design and installation.

    604.03 DESIGN OF CYLINDERS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        If the Contractor is required to design the cylinders, the design shall
        be treated as falsework in accordance with the requirements of Section
        613. The procedure for construction of the cylinder including
        requirements for sealing, shall be included on the drawings and shall
        be subject to the proof-engineering requirements of Section 613.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The cylinder shall comprise pre-cast concrete pipe(s) that comply with the
    requirements of the Australian Standard for Precast concrete pipes
    (pressure and non-pressure).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The wall of the cylinder shall be treated as non load-bearing formwork and
    the design shall incorporate a layer of compressible material at the top of
    the cylinder to prevent the transmission of foundation loads into the
    cylinder wall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The cylinder shall be robust and of sufficient strength to support
    temporary construction loads.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinders shall have the same durability and design life as the structural
    element that they support.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In situ concrete for cylinders shall comply with Section 610.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Reinforcement for cylinders shall comply with Section 611.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    604.04 PREPARATION OF FOUNDATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Excavation for cylinders shall comply with Section 602.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To prevent falls and the fall of objects into the cylinder, a safety
    barrier and kickboard shall be provided around the top of the cylinder
    throughout construction and until the cylinder has been filled. The barrier
    shall have a minimum height of 1 metre and shall be set back from the edge
    of the cylinder to allow access for working. The kickboard shall be at the
    rim of the cylinder and shall be a solid barrier with a minimum height of
    200 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Excavations for cylinders founded in rock shall penetrate the rock to the
    dimension shown on the drawings or to a depth of 150 mm, whichever is the
    greater, for the full circumference of the cylinder. The remaining exposed
    rock surface within the cylinder shall be trimmed and cleaned to remove any
    loose rock and soil.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Excavation for the base of the cylinder shall be treated in accordance with
    the requirements for rock subgrade as stated in Section 204 excluding the
    requirements for filling of depressions and capping.

    604.05 CONSTRUCTION OF CYLINDERS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinders shall be constructed in accordance with the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinders shall be vertical with a maximum tolerance on verticality of 25
    mm per 3 metres of depth and to the level stated on the drawings. Deviation
    from the position shown on the drawings shall not exceed 75 mm in any
    direction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinder sections shall be securely fixed together so as to prevent
    displacement and to exclude flowing water.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Damaged or displaced cylinder sections shall be removed and the cylinder
    re-assembled or replaced.
    <p>
    </p>

    604.06 SEALING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sealing of cylinders, if required, shall be in accordance with the drawings
    and shall be subject to the requirements of Clause 604.03.

    <strong>
        Concrete shall not be placed until the excavation and sealing has been
        approved by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cylinders shall be concreted within two days of completion of the
    excavation. Otherwise, the excavation shall be re&#8209;submitted for the
    Superintendent's approval.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be delivered and placed in accordance with Section 610.

    Where testing is required in the specification or shown on the drawings,
    the following testing shall be undertaken by the contractor:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Integrity testing shall be carried out on cylinders in accordance with
    integrity test methods specified in AS 2159. Integrity testing equipment
    shall be capable of checking cross-sectional irregularities in cylinders
    and identifying the location and characteristics of any significant
    anomalies such as voids or contaminants.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Acceptance criteria, supervision and reporting of integrity testing shall
    be in accordance with the requirements of AS 2159.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Testing shall be carried out on each cylinder constructed.
