    605.03 DRIVING SYSTEM
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles shall be driven with sufficient energy to install the pile and to
    achieve an ultimate capacity in excess of the specified pile test load
    without causing damage to the pile. Where earth retention with or without
    compression capacity piles are to be driven and excavation will not be
    undertaken prior to testing, the pile driving system shall be designed to
    have adequate energy to mobilise the entire length of the test pile. The
    methodology used in determining the pile capacity below the ultimate
    retention height of the test pile should be provided to the Superintendent
    for review prior to commencement of pile driving.
    <p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If a drop&#8209;hammer is used, the height of fall of the hammer shall not
    exceed 2 m.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide details of the driving system including the
    make, model and rated energy of the hammer, the mass of the helmet, and the
    proposed cap&#8209;block and cushion materials.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        These details, including calculations which demonstrate that the
        proposed driving system has sufficient energy to achieve the specified
        pile test load, shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review not
        less than 14 days prior to the commencement of pile driving.

    605.04 DRIVING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During driving, the tops of the piles shall be held and guided by a
    suitable helmet and protected by a cushioning material, to avoid damage to
    the pile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles shall be guided into the specified position and shall not be bent or
    sprung into place during or after driving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each pile shall be driven in a continuous operation and not left partly
    driven.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles that are to be extended shall be spliced immediately after the
    driving of a particular section has been completed. Driving shall
    re&#8209;commence as soon as the splice is completed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that piles achieve the specified accuracy of
    level and position. The following tolerances shall apply to piles after
    driving:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) pile alignment
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        deviation from the vertical or the specified rake shall not exceed 20
        mm per metre length of pile
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (b) pile straightness
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        deviation from vertical shall not exceed 5 mm per metre length of pile
        <p>
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    (c) pile position for piles in pile caps and the underside of crossheads
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        pile head centre, &#177; 50 mm of the specified position.

</p>
<p>
    Piles shall be driven to the levels shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles forced up by the driving of adjacent piles shall be re&#8209;driven
    to the specified toe level.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles shall achieve the specified ultimate load capacity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Set measurements shall be taken to verify capacity of each pile driven,
    recorded as traces during driving to show the temporary compression of the
    pile and the permanent set. Traces must be taken relative to a stable
    hurdle supported securely by posts at least one pile diameter from each
    side of the pile. Where set measurements cannot be undertaken due to
    OH&amp;S issues, the Contractor shall provide alternative methods to the
    Superintendent for review at least 7 days prior to pile driving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the ultimate load capacity is not achieved at the specified level, the
    pile shall have a restrike test undertaken in accordance with Clause 605.08
    - Restrike Test. If directed by the Superintendent, the pile shall be
    driven until the specified ultimate load capacity is achieved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If it is necessary to drive and/or extend the head of a pile below the
    underside of the pile cap, disturbance of the surrounding soil shall be
    minimised.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If it is necessary to drive piles through embankment fill, the full depth
    of the fill shall be pre&#8209;bored prior to pile driving. The diameter of
    the pre-bored hole shall not exceed the diagonal dimension of the pile
    minus 50 mm.

    *** Landfill sites containing domestic refuse shall be pre-bored prior to
    pile driving, or sufficient refuse shall be removed down to the natural
    surface to create a stable and safe working area prior to pile driving.
    Where excavation of refuse is required, the void created by removal of the
    refuse shall be backfilled with Type B material and compacted in accordance
    with Section 204. Disposal of refuse shall be in accordance with Section
    176 / Section 177##(strikethrough inapplicable section):.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After pile driving is completed, all voids resulting from pre-boring shall
    be filled with grout or sand. The area shall be reinstated and any damage
    made good.

    *** (a) Hiley Formula Testing ##(strikethrough option (a) if inappropriate
    - refer to Guide Notes - and delete the contents of this bracket):
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The first pile driven in each group shall be tested and the ultimate
    capacity determined in accordance with the formula in Clause 605.05(a).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The pile test will determine the driving set for each pile group by
    correlating the set with the driving system and the designer's requirements
    for the pile test loads shown on the drawings. All piles within that group
    shall be driven to a set not exceeding the driving set as determined by the
    pile test for that group.

</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    High-strain dynamic pile testing shall be performed to confirm that the
    design pile capacity and integrity has been achieved.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test procedure and test reports shall conform to the requirements of AS
    2159.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The pile driving system shall have adequate energy to mobilise a test pile
    by a single hammer blow.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Testing shall be carried out by use of a PDA or approved equivalent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The data obtained from each pile shall be analysed using CAPWAP or TNOWAVE
    or approved equivalent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The driving resistance and corresponding set per blow of the test pile
    shall be measured during PDA testing to extrapolate the results of the test
    pile to the piles in the pile group.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test results are required to demonstrate meeting the acceptance
    criteria shown on the drawings.

    The driving criteria for each pile group shall be determined by testing the
    first pile driven in each group in accordance with Clause 605.07(b)(i).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The pile test will determine the driving set for each pile group by
    correlating the driving system and design pile capacity. All piles within
    that group shall be driven to a set not exceeding the driving set as
    determined by the PDA test.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a pier or abutment has more than one pile cap, the piles within each
    pile cap shall be considered as a separate pile group.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    For large pile groups the number of piles tested shall be a minimum of 1 in
    30, and the distance of any pile from the test pile shall not exceed 20
    metres.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    An additional pile test shall be conducted where the driving conditions are
    no longer represented by the initial pile test for that pile group.
    Additional pile tests are required where:
    <p>
