<p>
    <strong>Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composite (FRPC):</strong>
    FRPC repair and strengthening systems are a combination of fibre
    reinforcing materials and resins such as epoxies and other adhesive
    materials, which can act in composite with a concrete structure to enhance
    its capacity and extend its life. The role of the resin is to provide the
    adhesive bond onto the concrete surface and facilitate the transfer of
    stresses to and from the fibres.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP):</strong>
    Carbon, aramid or glass fibres which are used to produce the various types
    of fibre reinforced polymer plates, strips, rods, sheets and fabric
    materials by impregnating or saturating them with epoxy resins or other
    adhesive materials as part of a complete manufacturing process.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Compatible epoxy putty shall only be used to fill voids, smooth surface
    discontinuities and treat minor imperfections prior to the application of
    other materials. Rough edges or lines of cured putty shall be ground smooth
    prior to proceeding with the installation. The putty shall have rapid
    strength gain characteristics which enable over-bonding to be carried out
    after a short time and shall be capable of being applied in thin layers
    where required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to applying the adhesive or the saturating resin the primer and putty
    filler shall be allowed to cure for the required period in accordance with
    the material manufacturer's specified requirements, to ensure satisfactory
    adhesion at the interface of the two materials. Where the primer and putty
    filler are completely cured, additional surface preparation may be required
    prior to the application of the saturating resin or adhesive consistent
    with the FRPC strengthening system compatibility requirements.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The environmental conditions shall be measured, recorded and assessed
    against the above requirements once every four hours of each shift. A
    calibrated commercially available hygrometer (psychrometer) or electronic
    climatic measuring gauge shall be used to determine the parameters which
    require readings (i.e. items (i), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (viii)).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If any of the prevailing on&#8209;site environmental conditions stated in
    this clause retard the curing and strength development of the adhesive, the
    Contractor shall implement accelerated curing measures, which shall include
    as a minimum the use of heating enclosures, covering with heating blankets
    and preheating of the adhesive prior to mixing, to ensure timely setting
    and satisfactory curing and strength development of the adhesive.
    <p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (g) Application of Plates, Laminates or Strips
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The bonding surface of the FRP plate, laminate or strip shall be thoroughly
    cleaned and where required abraded lightly as per the manufacturer's
    recommendations prior to application. Where cutting of the FRP laminate is
    required, it shall be installed securely to prevent any longitudinal
    splitting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The adhesive shall be applied to the prepared bonding concrete surface
    immediately after mixing as a thin layer by means of a notched steel trowel
    or equivalent. The adhesive shall cover the whole of the bonding area and
    shall be maintained at a thickness in the range of 1 mm to 2 mm. A further
    adhesive layer shall be applied to the cleaned and fully dried FRP plate,
    laminate or strip to form a dome profile across the plate with 3 mm of
    adhesive material in the centre and 1 mm on the edges.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The FRP plate, laminate or strip shall be brought into contact and lightly
    pressed with the fingers onto the prepared bonding area. The FRP material
    shall be further pressed on with a hard rubber roller until the extra
    adhesive is squeezed out along the sides. The roller pressure shall be
    applied from the centre going to the outer edge such that no voids are
    formed between the laminate and the concrete substrate surface. The excess
    adhesive shall be removed. The layer thickness of the final adhesive along
    the bond line of the laminate shall be a minimum of 1.5 mm and a maximum of
    3 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Adhesive residues on the laminate surface shall be removed with a
    compatible chemical remover prior to hardening.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required, additional parallel FRP plates, laminates or strips shall
    be applied at a minimum distance of 5 mm from the adjacent FRP material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where FRP plates, laminates or strips are lapped, the minimum overlap, in
    the longitudinal fibre direction, shall be 300 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the FRP plate, laminate or strip requires temporary support during
    curing the FRPC system shall be fully cured before the support is removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (h) Application of Fabric Sheets
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The saturating resin or bonding adhesive shall be uniformly applied at the
    coverage rates specified in the material manufacturer's data sheet to
    saturate the concrete surface using hand-held foam roller, brush or scraper
    to ensure adhesion of the fabric material. The fabric sheets shall be cut
    to the prescribed sizes using suitable cutters. The FRP fabric sheets shall
    be applied to the resin-saturated concrete surface by pressing manually
    onto the adhesive such that it is stretched in order to avoid wrinkles or
    the introduction of voids. The surface of the fabric shall be rolled over
    the backing paper to force the impregnation of the resin into the fabric
    material. Rolling shall be in the longitudinal direction of the fibres
    along the centreline and working outwards to expel excess adhesive at the
    edges to ensure the removal of any entrapped air and produce an even
    adhesive line. Any backing paper or other protective layer shall then be
    peeled away.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where subsequent layers of saturation resin are required as part of the
    FRPC strengthening system design, the Contractor shall allow the specified
    minimum time to elapse before applying the second coat of resin in
    accordance with the material manufacturer's data sheet. The time between
    mixing and application of the saturation resin shall be in accordance with
    the material manufacturer's data sheet.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where FRP fabric sheets or strips are lapped the minimum overlap in the
    longitudinal fibre direction, shall be 300 mm. Additional resin shall be
    applied to the outer surface of the fabric layer to be overlapped. No
    lapping in the lateral fibre direction shall be allowed. Any lifting or
    delamination that occurs during the application period shall be corrected
    by pressing the fabric sheet using a foam roller or spatula.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where multiple layers of FRP fabric sheet are required as part of the
    design of the FRPC strengthening system, these shall be applied in
    accordance with the material manufacturer's recommendations, data sheet,
    and as specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Where the resin is factory applied or it is applied onto the fabric
        on site using hand held foam rollers, brushes or impregnation machines
        prior to application, additional procedures on how the installation
        shall be supported shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review.

</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that the required surface preparation and
    roughness, cleanliness and drying out of the grooves is provided in
    accordance with the requirements of Clause 688.05(a) such that the required
    mechanical interlock between the adhesive and the concrete substrate is
    achieved. Dust and other contaminants shall be removed from the grooves
    immediately prior to filling with adhesive to prevent any adverse effects
    on the bond strength along the sides or bottom of the groove.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The adhesive shall be well mixed to the correct proportions with the
    correct equipment in accordance with the requirements of Clause 688.05(b)
    and (c) and shall be placed into the groove within the allowable gel or
    working time ensuring that air voids are eliminated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If any of the prevailing on&#8209;site environmental conditions stated in
    Clause 688.05(f) retard the curing and strength development of the
    adhesive, the Contractor shall implement accelerated curing measures,
    including use of heating enclosures and preheating the adhesive resins, to
    accelerate strength development and prevent traffic-induced vibration
    effects on the NSM FRPC strengthening system.

</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall undertake all inspection and testing of the installed
    FRPC strengthening system with calibrated equipment as specified in this
    clause. The Contractor shall maintain all required documentation and
    results as specified in this section and Section 160 for all stages of the
    work.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The work shall be inspected by the Contractor at each stage of the FRPC
    strengthening operation as a minimum, i.e. after surface preparations,
    mixing of materials, prior to and after adhesive and resin application and
    any touch&#8209;up that may be required and both during and after
    installation of FRP plates, laminates, strips or fabric sheets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For the purpose of surveillance and audits as specified in Section 160, the
    Contractor shall give the Superintendent five (5) days written notice of
    its intention to carry out repair or strengthening works and shall provide
    adequate access to enable surveillance of the works by the Superintendent.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Testing for Drummy Areas
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A visual inspection of the FRPC works shall be conducted immediately after
    installation is complete and any defects recorded. The cured FRPC
    strengthening system shall also be visually inspected and checked for
    delaminations, air voids, and bubbles between multiple layers or between
    the FRP material and the concrete, 7 days after completion of installation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The drummyness test shall be conducted along the whole length of each
    applied FRP plate, laminate, strip, rod or fabric sheet using a small
    hammer (or similar). Areas where the FRP material has not bonded correctly
    to the concrete or to subsequent layers will be characterised by a 'drummy'
    or hollow sound.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Delamination size, location, and quantity relative to the overall
    application area shall be recorded and evaluated with respect to structural
    integrity and durability of the FRPC system. Small delaminations less than
    25 mm x 25 mm do not require corrective action provided the total
    delaminated area is less than 5% of the FRPC strengthened area and provided
    that there are no more than 5 such delaminations per 1 m&#178;. Where these
    requirements are not complied with, the effective delaminated area shall be
    considered as a large delamination area and repaired in accordance with the
    requirements of Clause 688.09. Individual or isolated delaminations, air
    voids or bubbles larger than 25 mm x 25 mm shall be marked and repaired in
    accordance with the requirements of Clause 688.09.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the requirements of this clause no delaminations shall be
    permitted within 300 mm of the termination of FRP plates, laminate, strip,
    rod or fabric sheets.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Testing for Flatness
    <p>
    </p>

    The pull-off testing shall be undertaken in accordance with the
    requirements of AS 1012.24 using 50 mm diameter aluminium dollies only.
    Dollies with a diameter smaller than 50 mm shall not be allowed. Testing
    for FRP plates, laminates or strips shall be carried out at a frequency of
    three (3) tests per each 50 lineal metre run or part thereof of FRPC
    strengthened area. Testing for FRP fabric sheets shall be carried out at a
    frequency of three (3) tests per 5 m&#178; of FRPC strengthened area. The
    mean bond strength at 7 days shall be greater than 1.5 MPa, provided no
    individual result is below 90% of 1.5 MPa.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
    <strong>
        The mode of failure of the pull-off test shall be in the concrete
        substrate. Mean bond strengths less than 1.5 MPa or failure between the
        FRP system and the concrete substrate or between layers of FRPC shall
        be raised as a non-conformance for approval by the Superintendent.
        <p>
        </p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to undertaking design and installation works for FRPC strengthening
    of concrete bridge decks, the Contractor shall undertake an investigation
    to determine both the depth of concrete cover to the steel reinforcement
    and the thickness of the existing asphalt, as affected by any variability
    that may exist in shape and profile of the concrete deck. These
    measurements shall be allowed for in both the design and installation of
    the FRPC strengthening system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Such measurements shall be undertaken at 3 metre intervals and within a 3
    metre grid over the whole area to be strengthened and over the whole area
    where cold milling (cold planing) of asphalt may be required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The depth of concrete cover to the steel reinforcement shall be determined
    by using a commercially available concrete cover meter. The cover meter
    shall be supported with a current calibration certificate and shall be
    capable of detecting the presence of reinforcement and indicating the depth
    from the concrete surface to the nearest point on the surface of the
    reinforcement with an accuracy of &#177;1 mm at a depth of 25 mm. The
    thickness of asphalt shall be determined by taking 25 diameter cores
    through to the top surface of the concrete deck.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where cold milling is required, a milling procedure and ITP shall be
    submitted a minimum of 7 days prior to the commencement of cold milling of
    asphalt over the concrete bridge deck, allowing for the planned base of cut
    to the top surface of the concrete deck. The milling procedure shall
    include details on the type, mass and number of milling machine(s) and
    other equipment to be used and the proposed measures to control dynamic
    effects and proposed measures to avoid cutting damage to the concrete
    surface and steel reinforcement.
