    deteriorated, damaged or defective concrete;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the location of the patch repair on the concrete structure or
    component;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the proposed repair material properties, likely patch behaviour and
    the effect on load capacity and structural safety, serviceability and
    durability.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    A patch repair method shall be submitted which includes requirements for
    surface preparation, method of application, curing and surface finish, to
    ensure the longevity of the repair solution.
    <p>

    689.04 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Blowholes: </strong>
    Small regular or irregular cavities, usually not exceeding 15 mm in
    diameter or 5 mm in depth, resulting from entrapment of air bubbles in the
    surface of formed concrete during placement and consolidation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bond: </strong>
    The adherence between the repair material and the existing concrete
    substrate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bond strength (or pull-off strength):</strong>
    The resistance to separation of a repair material from the existing
    concrete substrate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Corrosion Deteriorated Concrete:</strong>
    Concrete with deterioration, delamination, cracking or spalling due to
    contamination by deleterious substances such as chlorides and carbon
    dioxide associated with the overall mechanism of corrosion of steel
    reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Delamination:</strong>
    The separation of a section of concrete from solid concrete usually along
    steel reinforcement which is identified by a drummy or hollow sound instead
    of a clear ringing sound when metal hits the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Exposure Classifications:</strong>
    Designation indicative of the most severe environment to which a concrete
    member is to be subjected during its design life, in accordance with the
    exposure classifications A, B1, B2, C1, C2 and U, as stated in Table 4.3 of
    AS 5100.5, and which are used to determine the concrete quality
    requirements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Fairing coat:</strong>
    A thin layer of cementitious material used to render large surface areas
    and cover, fill or smooth blowholes and surface imperfections flush with
    the finished concrete surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Featheredging:</strong>
    Cementitious repair material applied to the edge of the repair in a very
    thin layer instead of a thicker layer which is contained at the edge with a
    square cut.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Non-corrosion Deteriorated or Defective Concrete:</strong>
    Concrete with deterioration, damage or defects due to accidental or
    physical loadings, temporary overloading, impact and other mechanical or
    uncontaminated damage, excessive early shrinkage or thermal stresses and
    low quality honeycombed or off form voided concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Surface Imperfections:</strong>
    Surface voids or cavities not exceeding 5 mm in depth left on the concrete
    surface (in the form of surface honeycomb), due to failure of the mortar to
    effectively fill the spaces among coarse aggregate particles during
    placement and consolidation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Spall:</strong>
    A fragment of concrete broken off or detached from the edge of solid
    concrete due to the corrosion of steel reinforcement or due to accidental,
    physical or mechanical damage.

    For all types of patch repair all defective and delaminated concrete and
    existing repair materials shall be broken back to a sound and dense
    concrete surface. Defective concrete shall be removed using light hand held
    percussive equipment or high pressure water jetting. Care shall be taken to
    ensure that any steel reinforcement exposed is not cut or damaged. The
    method of breaking back or scabbling shall ensure that excess dust does not
    form a hazard in the surrounding area.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Hammer sounding shall be conducted on completion of breakout to ensure that
    all delamination has been removed. A perpendicular saw cut of at least 15
    mm shall be provided around the perimeter of the area to be repaired to
    prevent featheredging of the repair material. The saw cut surface shall be
    roughened by removing the surface layer to expose small particles of well
    bound aggregate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All concrete surfaces and mortar substrates shall be sound, clean and free
    from dust, oils, and grease and surface contaminants. All loose and unsound
    materials and surface laitance shall be removed.

    The concrete substrate and any exposed steel reinforcement shall be cleaned
    by a final wash down or by blowing down with oil free compressed air to
    ensure removal of all residual contamination. The prepared concrete
    substrate shall be thoroughly pre-wetted with clean fresh water and shall
    be surface dry prior to application of repair material.

    preparation and cleaning with a primer which forms part of the proprietary
    repair system to provide immediate protection against corrosion. The steel
    primer shall be adequately applied to the back of the steel reinforcement
    where it is fully exposed and where steel bars are tied together.
    Over-coating of the concrete substrate with the steel primer shall be
    avoided unless it is a requirement of the overall repair system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A substrate-bonding coat which also forms part of the proprietary repair
    system shall be worked into the concrete substrate using a short bristle
    brush to enhance the bond at the repair interface.
