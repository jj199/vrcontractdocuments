    682.03 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reinforced Soil Structure (RSS):</strong>
    An earth retaining structure comprising selected fill and soil
    reinforcement that is embedded at regular intervals in both vertical and
    horizontal directions within the fill to form a composite structure. The
    visible face of the RSS may incorporate decorative or structural reinforced
    concrete or masonry facing panels that include a strip foundation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Soil Reinforcement:</strong>
    Metallic or synthetic components that are embedded in the select fill and
    which act through interface friction, bearing or other means to provide the
    required strength and stability of the RSS. Soil reinforcement may be
    anchored at its trailing end.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Metallic Soil Reinforcement: </strong>
    Soil reinforcement made of steel or other metals in the form of straps or
    bars.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Synthetic or Flexible Soil Reinforcement:</strong>
    Soil reinforcement in the form of sheets, strips or grids made from
    synthetic materials.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Anchor: </strong>
    Steel plates, transverse bars or vertical pins that are installed
    permanently in the fill and that connect to the trailing end of the soil
    reinforcement. The anchors may be used to transfer load to the rear of the
    RSS or as a means of providing tension in the soil reinforcement during
    construction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Wall Facing Panel:</strong>
    Decorative and/or structural reinforced concrete or masonry facing elements
    retaining the compacted select fill material with provision for connection
    to the soil reinforcement. Wall facing may be full- height, sectional or
    segmental panels. Facing panels and walls include a strip foundation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Connection:</strong>
    Mechanical or other components which connect the wall facing panels to the
    soil reinforcement and which are designed to transfer loads between the
    soil reinforcement and the wall facing panels.

</p>
<p>
    Where future extensions of the RSS are indicated on the drawing or detailed
    as a requirement in the Contract, the design of the RSS wall shall allow
    for both initial and future configurations. For walls which are to be
    extended in height, the first stage reinforcement and facing panels shall
    have sufficient capacity to support subsequent increases in wall-height
    together with any surcharge without the need for enhancement. Removal and
    replacement of facing panel components to allow future extension is
    permitted.

    RSS block to promote drainage of surface water away from the wall facing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Filling and compaction shall be conducted with care in order to avoid
    damage to or displacement of reinforcing elements and facing panels.
    Tracked machines or vehicles shall not be allowed to traffic over or work
    on reinforcing elements until the reinforcement is protected by a minimum
    150 mm layer of fill material. Sheepsfoot rollers shall not be used for
    compaction of fill material.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Reinforcing elements shall be placed at the required level and position
    directly on top of the compacted fill material and connected to the wall
    panels in accordance with the design. Any twists, kinks, sags or deviations
    in the reinforcing elements shall be removed prior to the placement of fill
    material on the reinforcing. Wall construction shall include provision of
    inserts where specified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The level and alignment of each course of facing panels shall be checked
    progressively after placement of each course and prior to placement of the
    next course to ensure compliance with the dimensional and positional
    tolerances stated in the design. The Contractor shall record the results of
    this checking together with details of any non-conformances and the
    associated corrective actions.

    682.21 SHAPE OF REINFORCED SOIL STRUCTURE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To ensure compliance with the tolerances specified in Clause 682.20, the
    Contractor shall install stable and permanent survey reference points on a
    not more than 5 m (horizontal) by 2 m (vertical) grid covering the whole
    face of the RSS. The Contractor shall take measurements of the position of
    the RSS at the points defined in Clause 682.20(a) to (f) at intervals not
    exceeding one month for the first six months immediately following
    completion of the RSS and at intervals not exceeding six months thereafter
    until the end of the Defects Liability Period. The measurements shall be
    recorded in writing and reported to the Superintendent within two weeks of
    the survey.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall extrapolate these measurements in order to predict the
    position of the RSS at the end of its design life. The predicted position
    of the RSS shall be plotted on a log time scale plot. If the position of
    the RSS and its rate of movement at the end of the Defects Liability Period
    indicates that the specified positional tolerances will be exceeded before
    the end of the design life:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) the Contractor shall take remedial action at its own expense to ensure
    that the RSS will comply with the specified positional requirements
    throughout its design life;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) the Contractor shall continue to take measurements at its own expense
    until it is demonstrated that the RSS will comply with the positional
    requirements; and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) the Defects Liability Period shall be extended by an equivalent period
    or as agreed by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        In respect of Clause 682.21(a), not less than two weeks before the
        commencement of the remedial work, the Contractor shall submit its
        proposals for remedial work to the Superintendent for review.
