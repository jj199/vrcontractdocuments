    608.04 EXCAVATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Excavation shall consist of the excavation of the interiors of the pile
    casings and sockets, and the disposal of all excavated materials, and shall
    include all sheeting, bracing, drainage, pumping or bailing, and other
    necessary work and materials to enable the construction of the piles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All excavated material shall be removed from the site and disposed of as
    soon as practicable, so that the site of the works is kept in a clean and
    tidy condition.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If excavations are to be left open the Contractor shall ensure that they
    are made safe with appropriate fall protection measures such as guardrails
    with a footplate around the full perimeter of the pile hole, a sleeve
    extending at least 1 metre above ground level or a secure pile hole cover.
    Fall protection shall be provided at all times during excavation and after
    excavation is completed. The Contractor shall provide effective measures to
    protect each pile hole from site run&#8209;off and from loose material
    falling in.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring services or adjacent
    structures are not damaged by the piling operations. Where percussion
    equipment is used, the level of energy per blow of the percussion tool
    shall be kept to a minimum consistent with effective boring so as to
    minimise vibration and to avoid damage to the walls of the sockets,
    adjacent piles, structures or services.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After completion of excavation, the internal surfaces of casings shall be
    cleaned to remove soil adhering to the inside of the casing prior to
    placement of the steel reinforcement. Fixing of the steel reinforcement
    cage onto the steel casing shall not be allowed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Excavation to Bottom Casing Level
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The method of pile excavation and installation of the casing shall ensure
    that the ground is in contact with the casing at all times and no
    over&#8209;excavation or backfilling will be permitted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Casings shall be installed to provide penetration into the underlying
    bedrock to the levels or the dimensions shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the excavation is to be carried out under water, the level of water in
    the casing shall be maintained within 1 metre of ground natural surface
    level or above the level of the adjacent surface water.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Casings shall be installed so that the completed work complies with the
    tolerances specified.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Socket Formation and Inspection
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Socket bases shall be trimmed in near horizontal planes and all loose
    material, including rock fragments and other debris, shall be removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Immediately prior to concreting, the base of the socket shall be cleaned.
    Methods of cleaning i.e. airlifting or other alternatives shall be
    submitted to the Superintendent for review.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall control the lifting speed of the drilling equipment to
    ensure that no scouring and overbreak of the excavation occurs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        Following formation of the socket, the pile shall be de&#8209;watered
        to enable inspection by the Superintendent (or the Contractor's
        geotechnical representative in design and construct contracts) of the
        geology of the sides and base of the socket and to ensure that the base
        is free of debris. Reinforcement and/or concrete shall not be placed
        prior to this inspection.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide all plant, equipment including an inspection
    shield and labour necessary to provide safe and effective access for the
    inspection of the pile excavation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No person shall enter the pile excavation unless the appropriate
    precautions have been taken in accordance with:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017 - Part 3.4 - Confined

    If during de&#8209;watering, investigations reveal that the casing is not
    properly sealed or that the sides of the sockets have collapsed or that the
    overlying materials such as sands, gravels or silts have entered the socket
    or that the casing has deformed from its circular shape, the Contractor
    shall cease pumping and immediately re&#8209;fill the casing with water. In
    this case, the Contractor shall submit for the Superintendent's review
    details of the proposed procedures for overcoming the difficulties and for
    completing the construction of the pile including the method of inspecting
    the sides and base of the socket and to ensure that the base is free of
    debris in accordance with this specification.

    608.05 PROTECTION OF ADJACENT PILES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that the pile construction process does not
    result in damage to adjacent newly cast piles due to ground vibration. The
    following minimum requirements shall also be met:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) no pile construction shall be commenced within 2.5 m clear distance of
    a newly cast pile until the concrete in the pile has attained the strength
    of 15 MPa
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) piles more than 2.5 m clear distance from a newly cast pile may be
    installed by boring at any time providing there is no likelihood of damage
    to the newly cast piles
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) installation of piles by methods which involve driven casing or
    construction methods which result in significant vibration shall not be
    carried out within the distance 2.5 to 9.0 m until the concrete in the pile
    has set for 24 hours.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    608.06 STAGING OF CONCRETE CASTING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concreting of piles shall be carried out in two stages as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Stage 1
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concreting for Stage 1 involves placing concrete under water from the base
    of the pile socket to within 1 m (&#177;0.5 m) below the bottom of the pile
    reinforcement, or to a level 3 m (&#177;0.5 m) above the bottom edge of the
    casing, whichever is the higher. These limits apply to the level of sound
    concrete after removal of unsound concrete as specified for construction
    joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sockets shall be concreted within 24 hours of completion of the socket
    excavation. For delays greater than 24 hours, the Contractor shall ream the
    socket to remove not less than 25 mm minimum thickness of material, or any
    other foundation material which has softened in that time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete placed under water shall comply with the requirements of Clause
    608.07(a).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Stage 2
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This includes concrete placed in the dry for the remainder of the pile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction joint treatment between the two stages shall be as specified
    for construction joints.
    <p>
    </p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    608.07 PLACING CONCRETE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At least 4 weeks before commencing concreting operations, the Contractor
    shall submit to the Superintendent for review, details of all the plant and
    equipment proposed for use, a method statement of how the work will be
    carried out including action required in the event of concreting of tremie
    action break&#8209;down and details of the record sheets proposed for
    monitoring the operations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Pile Socket (Stage 1)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concreting using tremie methods shall not commence until the pile hole is
    filled with a head of water so as to equalise the external water pressure
    from the surrounding ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a tremie is used, the hopper and the pipe of the tremie shall be
    steel, smooth bore, clean and water tight throughout. The tremie pipe shall
    be sealed with a plate taped to its outlet, to prevent direct contact
    between the first discharge of concrete in the pipe of the tremie and the
    water. The tremie pipe shall extend to the base of the pile hole before the
    tremie is charged with concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a pump is used in lieu of a tremie, a sponge shall be inserted in the
    discharge line before the discharge hopper is loaded so that water and air
    in the line are prevented from mixing with the advanced column of fresh
    concrete. The end of the discharge hose shall be held against the bottom of
    the hole until the sponge is released, and the whole operation controlled
    to ensure that no voids are trapped in the pile concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concreting shall not commence until the tremie pipe or pump discharge hose
    are fully charged. During concreting, the outlet of the tremie pipe or pump
    discharge hose shall be kept a minimum of 2 m below the top surface of the
    concrete at all times and the Contractor shall continuously monitor and
    record the depth of the embedment. The method used for concrete placement
    shall be such that a continuous supply of concrete will be available at the
    top of the tremie tube or pump hopper during the entire process of placing
    concrete. Concreting shall be continued until sound concrete appears a
    minimum of 400 mm above the required cut&#8209;off level. The pile concrete
    shall not be cut back to its required level until a minimum of 24 hours
    after completion of placement of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete placed under water shall be self compacting concrete (SCC) in
    accordance with the requirements of Clause 610.07, Clause 610.13 and Clause
    610.18(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be of such consistency, and shall be placed in such a
    manner, that pockets of air or water or ground materials are not entrapped
    in the concrete, and the space between the reinforcement and the side walls
    of the hole are completely filled with compacted concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Pile Stem (Stage 2)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be placed in the dry and shall be compacted by immersion
    type, high frequency vibrators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be placed through a tremie tube, and concrete shall not be
    dropped from a height greater than 2 m through air.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete which is being discharged from a tremie shall be positively guided
    away from the pile reinforcement so that segregation is not caused by the
    flow of concrete impinging on the reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Alternative methods for placing concrete in the dry from those specified in
    this clause may be used subject to a review by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete placed in the dry shall be either self compacting concrete (SCC)
    or highly workable concrete in accordance with the requirements of Clause
    610.07, Clause 610.13 and Clause 610.18(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where highly workable concrete is placed in the dry, it shall be compacted
    with immersion type, high frequency vibrators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the socket is stable and is to be cast in the dry, Stage 1 and Stage
    2 may be cast continuously in accordance with the requirements of Clause
    608.06(b).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles placed in the dry shall be constructed to a minimum of 300 mm above
    pile cut-off level to allow breaking back of contaminated concrete at the
    top of the pile.

    in accordance with AS 2159.
    <p>
    </p>

    (c) Dynamic Pile Testing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to Integrity Testing and Static Load Testing, the Contractor
    shall carry out dynamic testing of piles to confirm that design pile
    capacity has been achieved. At least one (1) load test shall be performed
    for every 10 piles or one load test per pile cap or bridge abutment
    whichever gives the greatest number of pile testing. Dynamic testing shall
    also be carried out on piles of which the pile toe levels vary by more than
    2 metres from the test pile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that a pile driving rig with adequate capacity
    to mobilise the test pile with a single blow is employed during Dynamic
    Pile Testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the Contractor intends to seek dispensation of pile testing, the
    Contractor shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that
    an appropriate geotechnical investigation(s) has been carried out at the
    piling location with relevant geotechnical information at least 5 m below
    the design pile toe level. The submission shall include a proof engineer's
    certificate to confirm that where the pile is expected to develop its
    capacity, the lowest bound value of material strength established from the
    investigation has been adopted, and that a maximum geotechnical strength
    reduction factor of 0.45 has been adopted in the Ultimate Limit State
    geotechnical strength design in accordance with AS 2159. This information
    shall be provided to the Superintendent for review at least 4 weeks prior
    to construction. No consideration for dispensation of pile testing shall be
    given during or after construction.

    <strong>
        The details of the proposed pile driving rig, hammer size and drop
        heights shall be provided to the Superintendent for review prior to
        undertaking the testing.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Testing shall be carried out by use of a Pile Driving Analyser (PDA) and
    the data obtained from each pile shall be analysed using CAPWAP, TNOWAVE or
    other approved equivalent software.

    (d) Reporting
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test procedure and test reports shall conform with the requirements of
    AS 2159, and two copies of a report showing the measured field parameters
    and the results of analysis to determine pile capacity shall be provided to
    the Superintendent. Where confirmation of pile capacity using dynamic pile
    testing is obtained by re&#8209;strike, the report shall include the
    results of the initial drive and all subsequent re&#8209;strike.

    (e) Acceptance Criterion
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The integrity testing shall demonstrate that the measured cross-sectional
    area of each test pile is not less than 5% of the corresponding pile shown
    on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where piles are subjected to static load testing, the following criterion
    shall be satisfied:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the plot of pile settlement with log time shall be linear or
    decreasing rate of creep, and the creep rate shall be less than 2 mm per
    log cycle of time at the test load
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the maximum total pile settlement and lateral displacement at the
    design load shall not exceed the value shown on the drawings
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the test results are required to demonstrate meeting the acceptance
    criteria shown on the drawings, and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the measured ultimate capacity of test piles by dynamic testing
    shall be equal to or greater than the pile test load shown on the drawings.
