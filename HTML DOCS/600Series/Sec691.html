    691.08 SURFACE PREPARATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface preparation shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's
    recommendations for the waterproofing membrane system to be applied and as
    specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Concrete Surface Preparation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
Concrete surfaces to which the<strong> </strong>waterproof membranes    <strong> </strong>are applied shall be dry, clean, sound and free of dust
    or loose particles. Cement laitance, oil, grease, and any remnants of
    curing compounds and previous asphalt layers shall be removed from concrete
    surfaces by using grit blasting or bush hammer, scabbler, ultra high
    pressure potable water jetting to NACE WJ-2/SSPC-SP - WJ-2, or other
    approved means to provide a strong, hard surface. Areas of persistent
    contamination shall be removed from the surface by the use of appropriate
    solvents or detergents followed by washing with potable water in accordance
    with AS 1627.1. Any abrasive blast cleaning shall be carried out in
    accordance with AS 1627.4 and other OH&amp;S and Environmental regulations
    imposed by the local government authority and the Environment Protection
    Authority Victoria (EPA).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the surface of the concrete is weak, honeycombed or characterised by
    loose surface layers more material shall be removed, and repaired in
    accordance with the requirements Section 689. Shrinkage cracks of width
    less than 0.2 mm shall be filled with a suitable fairing coat cementitious
    repair material in accordance with the requirements of Section 689. Such
    repairs shall be sufficient to result in a strong, sound substrate suitable
    for the intended waterproofing membrane system. Projecting fins, rough
    spots and sudden steps shall be removed by light abrasion with an angle
    grinder to provide a surface which is suitable for the waterproofing
    membrane.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A trial application to check the suitability of the surface, the surface
    preparation methods and other requirements shall be undertaken as set out
    in Clause 691.16.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Primer Application
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Primers shall be applied by brush, mop, broom or spray in accordance with
    the manufacturer's recommendations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sufficient resources shall be provided for the application of resinous
    primers to ensure that the area to be primed is covered within the
    specified time limits. The pot life/gel and cure time of resinous primers
    at high ambient temperatures shall be allowed for during application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Solvent-based primers shall be applied in layers of uniform thickness to
    avoid leaving pockets of liquid beneath the dry skin. Trapped solvents
    which may expand rapidly under hot asphalt and which may lead to premature
    failure of the membrane shall be avoided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Primed surfaces which have become brittle or powdery shall be
    nonconforming. In such cases the deteriorated primer shall be removed and a
    new primer coat applied.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    691.09 WATERPROOFING MEMBRANE APPLICATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All concrete surfaces to receive a waterproofing membrane shall be dry at
    the time of application. Sufficient drying time shall be allowed after wet
    preparation methods to satisfy the requirements of Clause 691.17.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Waterproofing membranes shall not be installed on wet concrete surfaces.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The waterproofing membrane system shall be applied within 24 hours unless
    otherwise expressed in writing by the manufacturer after the preparation of
    the concrete surface. The prepared surface shall be protected against
    contamination and rain or expected rain if the waterproofing is not
    undertaken within 24 hours.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The waterproofing membrane shall not be applied if any of the conditions
    stated in Clause 691.14 exist. In addition, the membrane shall not be
    applied over any previously applied layer/coat which contains application
    defects or any damage until such defects have been repaired in accordance
    with Clause 691.20.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Air shall not be allowed to be trapped at the concrete/primer/membrane
    interfaces.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A trial application to check the suitability of the method of waterproofing
    membrane application shall be undertaken as set out in Clause 691.16.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Liquid Waterproofing Membrane Application
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The liquid waterproofing membrane system shall be applied in accordance
    with the manufacturer's requirements including application methods,
    overcoating times and coverage rates, mixing requirements, current
    materials safety data sheets and as specified in this section. Coverage
    rates of liquid applied membranes shall be checked for compliance with the
    manufacturer's requirements. The surface area of the concrete structure
    subject to application and the volume of liquid applied membrane used shall
    be recorded by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For multiple liquid applied membrane applications, the manufacturer's
    stated minimum and maximum overcoating times for the prevailing weather
    conditions shall be satisfied, and successive coats shall have slightly
    different colour shades to assist in achieving uniform coverage. The
    difference in colour shall be such that a coat when either wet or dry shall
    be clearly distinguishable by means of colour difference, from the
    preceding coat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the applied layer is too thin, or shows evidence of having been applied
    under unfavourable conditions, or the workmanship is poor, or the specified
    requirements are not fulfilled, the surface shall be re&#8209;treated to
    the extent required by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the methods of application are unacceptable to the Superintendent
    because of undesirable effects such as over spray, spatter or significant
    disruption to the public, alternative methods shall be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If, in the opinion of the Superintendent, conditions become unsatisfactory,
    work shall not be continued, and newly waterproofed surfaces shall be
    protected with shelters from rain or other damage as approved by the
    Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>

    are mixed until the application begins. No material shall be thinned unless
    specified by the material manufacturer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No material shall be applied after its pot life has expired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where quantities of material are being applied by spraying successive
    batches of premixed multi&#8209;part material, the equipment shall be
    flushed and purged with clean solvent after 2/3 of the pot life of the
    material has expired from either the mixing of the first batch or since the
    last purge and cleaning of the equipment. Material ingredients shall be
    kept properly mixed in the spray pots or container during the application
    of the material whether by continuous mechanical agitation or intermittent
    manual agitation as required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All waterproofing operations shall be performed in a neat and workmanlike
    manner by personnel with experience in the use of waterproofing membrane
    systems and application methods.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each applied layer shall have the required colour, gloss and opacity.

    in the opinion of the Superintendent, show excessive film builds shall be
    removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each applied layer shall be smooth, uniform and free from sags, runs, mud
    cracking, wrinkling, fat edges, blisters, pinholes, holidays, dry spray,
    entrapped foreign bodies and heavy brush marks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Preformed Waterproofing Membrane Application
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Placement of preformed sheets shall commence at the lowest section and
    proceed to higher sections, so that water does not flow into any joints
    during service.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All necessary precautions shall be taken during asphalt placement to avoid
    softening, indentation and damage of the waterproofing membrane.

    691.24 REMOVAL AND REINSTATEMENT OF THE ASPHALT PAVEMENT ON CONCRETE BRIDGE
    DECKS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Removal of Asphalt
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure the removal of the existing asphalt does not
    damage the concrete deck or create grooves within the concrete. The asphalt
    shall be removed such that the concrete surface remains relatively smooth
    and level in order to ensure optimum performance of the waterproofing
    membrane.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to undertaking installation works for the waterproofing of concrete
    bridge decks, the Contractor shall undertake an investigation to determine
    both the depth of concrete cover to the steel reinforcement and the
    thickness of the existing asphalt, as affected by any variability that may
    exist in shape and profile of the concrete deck. These measurements shall
    be allowed in the installation of the waterproofing membrane system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Such measurements shall be undertaken at 3 metre intervals and within a 3
    metre grid over the whole area where cold milling (cold planing) of asphalt
    will be undertaken.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The depth of concrete cover to the steel reinforcement shall be determined
    by using a commercially available concrete cover meter. The cover meter
    shall be supported with a current calibration certificate and shall be
    capable of detecting the presence of reinforcement and indicating the depth
    from the concrete surface to the nearest point on the surface of the
    reinforcement with an accuracy of &#177;1 mm at a depth of 25 mm. The
    thickness of asphalt shall be determined by taking 25 diameter cores
    through to the top surface of the concrete deck.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    An asphalt milling procedure and ITP shall be submitted a minimum of 7 days
    prior to the commencement of cold milling of asphalt over the concrete
    bridge deck, allowing for the planned base of cut to the top surface of the
    concrete deck. The milling procedure shall include details on the type,
    mass and number of milling machine(s) and other equipment to be used and
    the proposed measures to control dynamic effects and proposed measures to
    avoid cutting damage to the concrete surface and steel reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nil tolerance shall apply on the depth of milling cut to the surface of the
    concrete deck. No grooving of the concrete surface shall be allowed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A milling machine with fine milling drum shall be used on concrete bridge
    decks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During the cold milling operation all necessary precautions shall be taken
    to prevent the cutting teeth from contacting the concrete surface or
    existing waterproofing membrane. The actual depth of cut shall be measured
    on both sides of the cold milling machine at intervals not exceeding 3
    metres.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All milling work shall be subject to continuous observation for variability
    or change in cut surface appearance and all observations documented.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In the event that the cutting teeth contact the concrete surface the
    progress of the cold milling machine shall cease immediately, any machine
    fault repaired and the machine settings and controls readjusted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Milling operators shall have adequate training and experience in the
    operation of the cold milling machine and automatic sensing equipment.
    Relevant experience and training records of each operator shall be
    submitted to the Superintendent for review prior to the commencement of
    work on site.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During milling operations the Contractor shall provide three suitably
    trained and skilled milling machine operators at the cold milling machine
    at all times, one on the driving platform and one on each side of the
    machine generally in the vicinity of the sensor/cutting mandrel.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    At the completion of cold milling, all loose milled material shall be
    removed and the concrete surface prepared in accordance with the
    requirements of this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Reinstatement of Asphalt
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The asphalt layers shall be placed and compacted to the original road level
    and profile over the bridge deck in accordance with Section 407 to provide
    a smooth transition between the bridge approaches/bridge departures, over
    expansion joints and the bridge deck pavement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Care shall be taken during the placement and compaction of the asphalt
    layer to ensure that the asphalt machinery does not damage the
    waterproofing membrane system.
