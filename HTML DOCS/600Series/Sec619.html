    619.04 TYPES OF BOX CULVERTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The types of culvert covered by this specification are as designated in AS
    1597.1, Clause 1.5:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) 'U' shape consisting of invert and lid.

</p>
<p>
    (b) Inverted 'U' shape consisting of crown and base.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Note: Where the word unit appears in this specification, it is deemed to
    mean a complete box culvert as described above.

</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified or shown on the drawings box culvert dimensions
    shall comply with the requirements of Table 2.5 of AS 1597.1 and the
    standard nominal length of box culverts shall be as follows:
    <p>

        The concrete may also contain chemical admixtures, details of which
        shall be submitted for review by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    In its finished state concrete shall be sound and dense and durable and
    free from honeycombing and shall have the strength and other properties
    specified.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Minimum Portland Cement Content
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum mass of portland cement in concrete mixes containing GGBF Slag,
    Fly Ash or Amorphous Silica shall be 60%, 75% or 90% respectively, of the
    total mass of cementitious material in the concrete mix. The inclusion of
    GGBF Slag, Fly Ash or Amorphous Silica in concrete mixes shall only be in
    single or double combination with portland cement. In a triple blend
    concrete mix, the portland cement content shall be a minimum of 60% and the
    individual contribution of GGBF Slag, Fly Ash or Amorphous Silica shall be
    a maximum of 40%, 25% or 10% respectively, of the total mass of the
    cementitious material in the concrete mix.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Cementitious Type and Content for Saltwater Applications and Exposure
    Classification C1 and C2
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Box culverts used in saltwater applications or exposure classification C1
    and C2 shall be manufactured with concrete containing at least 20% fly ash
    and 7% to 10% silica fume as a replacement of portland cement, or at least
    30% fly ash as a replacement of portland cement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Chemical Admixtures
    <p>
    </p>

    Chemical admixtures when used shall comply with the requirements of AS
    1478. They shall be used in accordance with the requirements of Clause 2.5
    of AS 1379 and the manufacturer's recommended method of use and shall not
    reduce the strength of concrete below that specified. Chemical admixtures
    shall be accurately measured by means of dispensers which are subject to
    regular maintenance and are calibrated as a minimum at three monthly
    intervals. Chemical admixtures shall not contain calcium chloride, calcium
    formate, chlorine, sulphur, sulphides or sulphites.
    <p>

    (d) Aggregates
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Source rock shall comply with the requirements of Section 801 - Source Rock
    for the Production of Crushed Rock and Aggregates. Fine and coarse

    Immersion vibrators of adequate size, number and frequency shall only be
    used as back-up when external vibrators fail. Care shall be taken to ensure
    that no steel reinforcement or embedded items are displaced by vibration.

    619.10 CURING, STRIPPING AND REMOVAL FROM FORMWORK
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be cured using one or a combination of methods described in
    this clause.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall be protected from moisture loss until commencement of
    curing, which shall continue until the concrete reaches the age or the
    maturity, whichever is the lesser, and the compressive strength is as shown
    in Table 619.101. The concrete compressive strength for checking the
    adequacy of curing shall be determined by test cylinders cured with and in
    the same manner as the concrete unit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The unit shall not be completely stripped from all forms or handled off the
    base forms until the compressive strength reaches 15 MPa. Curing shall be
    carried out to meet the requirements of Table 619.101 and where curing is
    interrupted by more than 30 minutes the unit shall be protected from
    moisture loss.

</p>
<p>
    Where box culverts are to be placed in saltwater applications, stainless
    steel spacers or plastic bar chairs shall be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete cover to the steel reinforcement shall be measured with a
    calibrated cover meter to ensure compliance with the requirements of Clause
    619.07. The Contractor shall select one unit for concrete cover
    measurements from each 100 units of a batch or a maximum period of 3 months
    production. The cover meter device shall be capable of detecting the
