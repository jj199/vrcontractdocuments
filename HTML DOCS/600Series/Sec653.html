    653.01 GENERAL
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for the manufacture, testing,
    protective treatment, supply and installation of bearings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bearings shall be designed to support the loads and to accommodate the
    movements and rotations shown on the Drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section also applies to the manufacture, protective treatment and
    supply of any bearing attachment plate assemblies required to anchor the
    bearing to a substructure or superstructure component.

    653.03 INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall submit the following information for each bearing
    type:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) name of manufacturer
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) rated load and movement capacity
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) dimensioned drawings showing all components.

    <strong>
        At least 10 working days before the proposed commencement of
        manufacture the Contractor shall forward to the Superintendent, a
        certificate which details the information required above and which
        verifies compliance with this Specification.

<p>
    653.04 DESIGN AND FABRICATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Design of bearings shall comply with the requirements of AS 5100:2017.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    653.05 TESTING OF BEARINGS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Testing of bearings shall be conducted in accordance with AS 5100:2017.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After testing, bearings shall be dismantled and examined for distress,
    warping, scoring or other effects which may affect the durability of the
    bearing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A bearing will be rejected if it exhibits any signs of failure as described
    in the relevant clauses.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If a bearing is rejected, two additional bearings from the batch it
    represents shall be tested. If both bearings meet the requirements of this
    Specification, the remaining bearings in the batch will be accepted.
    Otherwise each remaining bearing in the batch shall be tested to determine
    its compliance with the Specification.
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    653.06 TEST CERTIFICATES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the installation of the bearings the Contractor shall submit to
    the Superintendent copies of certificates showing the test results of each
    bearing test. The test certificates shall show whether any tolerances have
    been exceeded or faults observed.

    653.07 PROTECTIVE COATINGS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel components of bearings (other than stainless steel sliding surfaces)
    shall be coated with zinc&#8209;in&#8209;silicate in accordance with the
    requirements of Section 631 including preparation of surfaces.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bolts, nuts and washers shall be hot- dip galvanized in accordance with
    Section 631.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Stainless steel sliding surfaces shall not receive protective coatings and
    care shall be taken to protect these surfaces from being damaged or coated
    during the application of the protective treatment to other surfaces.

    653.08 SHOP ASSEMBLY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    653.09 MOVEMENT INDICATOR
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If shown on the drawings, or specified, a movement indicator and suitably
    located scale shall be securely fixed to the bearings to enable shear
    movements to be monitored.
    <p>

    653.10 MARKING AND DELIVERY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bearings shall be suitably marked to identify their location in the
    bridge. Bearings required to be preset for horizontal movement shall be
    clearly marked to ensure they are installed in the correct orientation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Mating parts of bearings shall be permanently marked, and shall be supplied
    in sets held together with metal transit clips and/or bolts to prevent
    misalignment and/or damage of the components during transport and erection.
    Transit clips and/or bolts shall not be removed until final installation in
    the bridge or at the time specified on the drawings.

</p>
<p>
    Bearings stored on site prior to installation shall be protected from
    exposure to chemicals, fuel, oil, water, mud, dust, flood waters or any
    other deleterious substance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If bearings are contaminated or damaged in any way, they shall be cleaned
    of all contaminants and offered to the Superintendent for inspection.
    Bearings that are damaged by contamination, inadequate storage or handling
    shall be replaced at the Contractor's expense.

</p>
<p>
    Bearings shall be installed to the correct position and orientation as
    shown on the Drawings and, where applicable, in accordance with the bearing
    supplier's installation procedures. Bearings shall be installed level or to
    the specified grade &#177;0.5%.
