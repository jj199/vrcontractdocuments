    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the production requirements of 20 mm nominal size for
    pavement subbase treated with a cementitious binder to produce a bound
    material.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Crushed rock produced from a variety of raw feed sources including
        quarries, crushed concrete and Newer Basalt Surface Spalls (NBSS) can
        be utilised for this application, along with registered crushed rock
        blends containing supplementary materials.

</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall determine the content of cementitious binder required
    to meet the minimum 7 day UCS specified in Table 815.101 using modified
    compaction. The cementitious binder content may be further increased to
    allow for the effects of production variability. The binder content so
    determined shall become the Design Cementitious Binder Content which shall
    not be less than the minimum cementitious binder content specified in Table
    815.101. During manufacture, the cementitious binder content shall be
determined in accordance with AS 5101.3.3    <em>Cement content of cement stabilized materials</em> as listed in Section
    175.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cementitious binder shall be added and mixed into the crushed rock to
    produce a uniform binder content.

</p>
<p>
    (b) Unconfined Compressive Strength Test
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out UCS testing in accordance with the test
    frequency specified in Table 815.141. The UCS test result shall be the mean
UCS determined from a pair of specimens tested in accordance with AS 5101.4    <em>Unconfined compressive strength of compacted materials</em> as listed
    in Section 175 and compacted using modified compactive effort.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For the purposes of UCS testing, one representative sample of fully mixed
    cement treated material shall be taken either from the plant or at the
point of delivery in accordance with AS 5101.2.2    <em>Sampling - Preparation of stabilised pavement materials</em> as listed
    in Section 175 and compacted in the mould within two hours of mixing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The UCS during production shall be assessed on a 'rolling average' basis
    where the average of the most recent three UCS test results shall not be
    less than the minimum value specified in Table 815.101.

</p>
<p>
    Where the Contract includes supply and delivery only, the moisture content
    of the mixture at the point of delivery, expressed as a percentage by mass,
    shall be within +0.5% to &#8209;1.0% of the target nominated by the
    Superintendent.

    815.14 MINIMUM TESTING REQUIREMENTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall test CTCR products at such a frequency and within the
    relevant time limits to ensure that the supplied material consistently
    complies with the relevant specified requirements of VicRoads Standard
    Sections, Code of Practice 500.02 and any additional testing specified as a
    condition of registration of the crushed rock mix.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test frequency shall initially not be less than that shown in Table
    815.141, except that the test frequency for Grading, Unsound Rock Content,
    Plasticity Index, UCS and Degradation Factor - Fine Aggregate may be
    halved, where the most recent ten successive test results have met the
    specified requirements. If any subsequent test result fails, another test
    shall be immediately undertaken. If the second test fails, the test
    frequency shall revert to the minimum frequency specified in Table 815.141
    and the Contractor shall not return to half the test frequency until a
    further ten successive test results comply with the specified requirements.
