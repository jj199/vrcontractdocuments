    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for Classes A, B and C aggregate
    produced by crushing and screening for use in sprayed bituminous surfacing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The classes and sizes of aggregate to be supplied and stacksite
    requirements are specified in Section 408.

<p>
    <strong>Aggregate</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate consists of substantially one&#8209;sized mineral particles used
    as a cover material applied to a thin membrane of bituminous material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Assigned Los Angeles Value
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The assigned Los Angeles Value (LAV) is a hardness rating derived from Los
    Angeles Value test results, which is assigned annually to each source by
    VicRoads as per Code of Practice for Source Rock Investigations as listed
    in Section 175.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Assigned Polished Stone Value
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The assigned Polished Stone Value (PSV) is a friction rating derived from
    Polished Stone Value test results which is assigned annually to each source
    (where applicable) by VicRoads as per Code of Practice for Source Rock
    Investigations as listed in Section 175.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Average Least Dimension
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Average Least Dimension (ALD) is the average height of the aggregate
    particles when they are spread as a single layer with their least dimension
    vertical.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Crushed Aggregate
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    An aggregate produced by crushing and screening of rock spalls or other
    material approved by the Superintendent which has fully (or 100%) crushed
    faces.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Partly Crushed Aggregate
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    An aggregate produced by washing, crushing and screening of a suitable
    material (e.g. coarse gravel), which may not have fully crushed faces.

    831.03 SOURCE ROCK
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Source rock used for the production of aggregates shall comply with the
    requirements specified in Section 801 and shall be obtained from a VicRoads
    accredited source, with a current assigned LAV and where required a current
    assigned PSV.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Synthetic or blended aggregates from different sources shall only be used
    with the approval of the Superintendent.

    831.04 AGGREGATE REQUIREMENTS AND TESTING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sampling and testing of aggregates shall be undertaken in accordance with
    VicRoads Codes of Practice 500.16 and 500.09.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General Requirements
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Crushed aggregate shall consist of clean, hard, durable, angular
    fragments of rock and shall be free from clay and organic matter. River
    gravel, and calcrete and other sedimentary rocks shall not be used for the
    production of Class A sealing aggregate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Partly crushed aggregate shall be produced by crushing clean, hard,
    durable particles of gravel and shall be free from clay and organic matter.
    The aggregate shall have a minimum of 75% by mass of aggregate particles
    having two or more faces produced by crushing. Partly crushed aggregate
    shall only be used for the production of Class B and C sealing aggregate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Sampling of Aggregate
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sampling of aggregate for specified testing shall be based on lots. A
    lot shall consist of not more than 350 tonnes of aggregate of the same
    class and size. The lot shall be uniform in appearance and be produced from
    the same source and under the same conditions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    VicRoads may agree to increased lot sizes up to 700 tonnes, where the
    supplier demonstrates that the source rock is of consistent quality and
    there is a history of satisfactory test results and performance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each lot of aggregate shall be assigned a unique identification number
    and/or unique stockpile location. Lots shall be stockpiled separately to
    ensure aggregate testing is fully traceable.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A representative sample shall be taken at random from each lot and tested
    for compliance with the requirements specified in Clauses 831.04(d), (e)
    and (f) not more than 90 days prior to delivery.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Testing of Aggregate
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        The results of all testing as required by this section shall be
        provided to the Superintendent prior to delivery.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Unsound and Marginal Rock
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unsound and marginal rock in that fraction of a sample retained on a 4.75
    mm AS sieve shall not exceed the values specified in Table 831.041.
    Notwithstanding the requirements of Clause 831.04(b) regarding lot size,
    where daily production of the same source and class of aggregate exceeds
    350 tonnes per day, the lot testing for unsound and marginal stone can be
    reduced to one lot per day.

    For 7 mm aggregate and larger, testing of ALD values is required for each
    lot of aggregate supplied under the Contract in accordance with the
    relevant ALD test methods contained in Section 175 (refer Codes of Practice
    500.09 and 500.16) and based on lot requirements as specified in Clause
    831.04(b).

    831.05 ACCEPTANCE OF AGGREGATE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If all of the specified test results comply with the relevant requirements
    of Clauses 831.04(d), (e) and (f) the aggregate represented by the lot will
    be accepted.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If any of the individual test results do not comply with the relevant
    requirements of this clause the lot will be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate which does not meet the above acceptance criteria shall not be
    supplied or delivered.

    831.06 PRECOATING OF AGGREGATE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate shall be precoated with suitable precoating material and each
    particle shall be uniformly coated to the satisfaction of the
    Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Only aggregates which have been tested and meet the requirements of Clause
    831.05 to the Superintendent's satisfaction shall be precoated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Precoating of aggregate for primer sealing shall be at the discretion of
    the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A typical precoating material shall have a viscosity in the range 0.003 to
    0.020 Pa.s at 60&#176;C and contain a bitumen residue of between 25% and
    40% by mass and an adhesion agent of 1% by volume at normal concentration.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The use of alternative precoating materials will be considered.
        Specific proposals shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review
        not less than 10 business days prior to use.

    831.07 DELIVERY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregate shall not be delivered directly from stockpiled lots at the
    quarry to the stacksites unless the aggregate has been tested and meets the
    acceptance of all test requirements to the satisfaction of the
    Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where delivery of aggregate is made to stacksites at or near the site of
    the sealing works, delivery shall be made to separate identifiable stacks
    for each lot of aggregate tested. Once delivery is commenced the Contractor
    shall continue to promptly complete the delivery of the entire lot.
