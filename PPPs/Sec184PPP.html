    SECTION 184 - DETERMINATION AND REPORTING OF NOTIONAL LIFE (PPP)
</p>
<p>
    18<a name="np184"></a>4.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section relates to the calculation and reporting of pavement Notional
    Life of a given Notional Life 100 m Sub Section.
</p>
<p>
    There are two applicable but separate technical rationale for the
    determination of the nominal life of discrete pavement segments. The two
    techniques are applicable to:
</p>
<p>
    i. Pavements with asphalt<strong> </strong>thickness less than 50 mm,
</p>
<p>
    ii. Pavements with asphalt thickness 50 mm or greater.
</p>
<p>
    The application of this Standard Section requires use of the associated
    Spreadsheet Model.
</p>
<p>

<p>
    180.03 MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF PAVEMENT NOTIONAL LIFE
</p>
<p>
    (a) Pavements with Asphalt Thickness Less than 50 mm
</p>
<p>
    The Notional Life for this pavement type is determined from the
    distribution of lives after notional pavement reshaping to correct
    roughness and rutting but without notional strengthening, calculated as
    follows:
</p>
<p>
    i. Testing shall be carried out during November and/or December.
</p>
<p>
    ii. Measure the surface deflections in the left-hand wheel path of each
    lane using either a Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD), Benkelman Beam, or
    Deflectograph. Deflection measurements are to be at intervals of 20 m or
    less. Pavement temperature shall be measured during the deflection testing
    in accordance with Austroads Guide to Asset Management - Technical
    Information - Part 15: Technical Supplements (2018).
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    iii. Convert the measured FWD, and Deflectograph maximum deflections to
    Benkelman Beam D<sub>0</sub> values in accordance with Austroads (2011).
</p>
<p>
    iv. For all deflection devices, the measured deflections are not to be
    adjusted for seasonal moisture variations.
</p>
<p>
    v. Calculate the characteristic maximum deflection (CD) in the left-hand
    wheel path for each Notional Life 100 m Sub Section in accordance with
    Austroads (2011) and the Spreadsheet Model.
</p>
<p>
    vi. Calculate the allowable traffic loading in Equivalent Standard Axles
    (ESAs) after notional pavement reshaping using the value of the CD in
    accordance with Austroads (2011) and the Spreadsheet Model.
</p>
<p>
    vii. Calculate the Notional Life for each Notional Life 100 m Sub Section
    within the network in accordance with the Spreadsheet Model. An upper limit
    of 30 years is to be applied to the Notional Life. Notional Life shall be
    rounded down to the nearest whole year.
</p>
<p>
    viii. Report results as described in Clause 184.03(c).
</p>
<p>
    For this model, it is assumed that any pavement reshaping less than 50 mm
    does not provide any national strengthening.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Pavements with Asphalt Thickness 50 mm or greater
</p>
<p>
    The Notional Life for this pavement type is determined from the
    distribution of lives after resurfacing with a notional 50 mm thick, Size
    14 mm Class 320 bitumen dense graded asphalt overlay, calculated as
    follows:
</p>
<p>
    i. Testing shall be carried out during November and/or December.
</p>
<p>
    ii. Measure the surface deflections in the left-hand wheel path of each
    lane using either a FWD, Benkelman Beam or Deflectograph. Deflection
    measurements are to at intervals of 20 m or less. Pavement temperature
    shall be measured during the deflection testing in accordance with
    Austroads Guide to Asset Management - Technical Information - Part 15:
    Technical Supplements (2018).
</p>
<p>
    iii. Convert the measured FWD and Deflectograph maximum deflections to
    Benkelman Beam D<sub>0</sub> values in accordance with Austroads (2011).
</p>
<p>
    iv. For all deflection devices, the measured deflections are not to be
    adjusted for seasonal moisture variations.
</p>
<p>
    v. Calculate the characteristic maximum curvature (CC) in the left-hand
    wheel path for each Notional Life 100 m Sub Section in accordance with
    Austroads (2011) and the Spreadsheet Model.
</p>
<p>
    vi. Calculate the allowable traffic loading in ESAs after notional 50 mm
    overlay, using the value of the CC in accordance with Austroads (2011) and
    the Spreadsheet Model.
</p>
<p>
    vii. Calculate the Notional Life for each Notional Life 100 m Sub Section
    within the network in accordance with the Spreadsheet Model. An upper limit
    of 30 years is to be applied to the Notional Life. Notional Life shall be
    rounded down to the nearest whole year.
</p>
<p>
    viii. Report results as described in Clause 184.03(c)
</p>
<p>
    (c) Reporting of Results
</p>
<p>
    Notional Life is to be reported for each Notional Life 100 m Sub Section
    for every Test Lane, including all inputs and outputs from the Spreadsheet
    Model.
