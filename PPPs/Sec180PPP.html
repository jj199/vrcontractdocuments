    18<a name="np180"></a>0.01 GENERAL
</p>
<p>
    This section relates to ride quality performance for all new pavement
    construction of all finished roadways which form part of the Project
    Assets.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    180.02 PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
</p>
<p>
    The finished surface of the pavement shall have a smooth longitudinal
    profile and comply with the minimum ride quality requirements specified.
    The upper limits for roughness at various locations are specified in the
    Project Scope and Delivery Requirements.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    180.03 DEFINITIONS
</p>
<p>
    <strong>International Roughness Index (IRI</strong>
    <strong><sub>qc</sub>)</strong>
    - The international measure of ride quality measured and recorded by modern
    Class 1 profile measuring devices in cumulative metres per kilometre in
    each wheel path and averaged together. For the purposes of this
    specification, roughness measurement is to be based on the IRI<sub>qc</sub>
    quarter car model.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Individual Lane Roughness Value</strong>
    - The mean value of the two wheel path IRI<sub>qc</sub> values measured on
    a 100 m sub&#8209;section of a traffic lane.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mean Lane Roughness Value</strong>
    - The mean of the Individual Lane Roughness Values within a Work Lot as
    determined by the appropriate test method.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Measuring Device</strong>
    - The device used for measurement of roughness must be:
</p>
<p>
    (a) capable of measuring the longitudinal road surface profile along one or
    both wheel paths at least every 250 mm with a precision in elevation of 0.5
    mm over a wave band of 1 to 30 metres;
</p>
<p>
    (b) calibrated according to the relevant test methods.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Work Lot</strong>
    - Means any part of the work constructed or manufactured under essentially
    uniform conditions in a continuous operation and which is essentially
    homogeneous with respect to material properties, general appearance and
    construction or manufacturing process. Each lot must be no more than 2 km
    in length.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    180.04 MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF RIDE QUALITY
</p>
<p>
    (a) Scope of Testing
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise approved by the State, the surface of all pavement
    construction must be tested for ride quality.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Lot Testing
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk498000159">
        All work must be tested in Work Lots. Testing must include all traffic
        lanes constructed within each Work Lot including any freeway ramps but
        excluding shoulders and turn lanes. Project Co must provide 24 hours
        notice to the Independent Reviewer (where applicable) and the State
        when ride quality testing will be undertaken and the limits for each
        Work Lot.
    </a>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    (c) Measurement of Ride Quality
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must measure the longitudinal road surface profile of each Work
    Lot in accordance with the relevant Test Method applicable to the
    particular test equipment being used as listed in VicRoads Standard
    Specification Section 175.
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise approved by the State, ride quality measurement must be
    undertaken within three months after the application of the final surfacing
    layer.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Reporting of Test Results
</p>
<p>
    Results must be processed and reported for each 100 m sub&#8209;section.
    Any sub&#8209;sections less than 100 m must be included with the
    sub&#8209;section immediately preceding it and the individual roughness
    calculated over the longer sub&#8209;section. Project Co must provide the
    Independent Reviewer and the State with a copy of all test results
    representing the final roughness survey of the completed pavement works
    together with the calculated values of the individual lane roughness for
    each 100 m sub-section and mean lane roughness for each Work Lot.
</p>
<p>
    180.05 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must comply with the requirements for both the Maximum
    Individual Lane Roughness and Maximum Mean Lane Roughness as follows.
</p>
<p>
    (a) Individual Lane Roughness
</p>
<p>
    Where an Individual Lane Roughness Value in any 100 m sub&#8209;section is
    greater than the specified Maximum Individual Lane Roughness Value
    specified in Project Scope and Delivery Requirements, Project Co must
    rectify work within the sub&#8209;section to comply with this requirement.
    The minimum length of rectification work undertaken must be 100 m.
</p>
<p>
    All rectified 100 m sub&#8209;sections must be re&#8209;tested following
    completion of rectification work.
</p>
<p>
    (b) Mean Lane Roughness
</p>
<p>
    Where the Mean Lane Roughness Value of a Work Lot is greater than the Mean
    Lane Roughness specified in Project Scope and Delivery Requirements,
    Project Co must rectify the work within this Work Lot to comply with this
    requirement. The minimum length for any rectification work undertaken must
    be 100 m.
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must re&#8209;test the Work Lot following completion of any
    rectification work.
</p>
<p>
    180.06 PAVEMENT RECTIFICATION
</p>
<p>
    Project Co must bear the full cost of any necessary rectification work
    including the cost of any additional work required to the underlying or
    adjacent pavement to comply with this section.
</p>
