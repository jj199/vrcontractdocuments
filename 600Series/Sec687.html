<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall submit all details of crack filling procedure for
        review by the Superintendent 14 days prior to commencement of the
        Works.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Materials
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Cold curing, two component, solvent free, unfilled epoxy or polyurethane
    resin adhesives may be used to seal cracks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Execution of the Works
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each crack shall be treated in a single continuous operation and shall be
    filled completely. The Contractor shall comply with the temperature ranges
    for application and any other material specific constraints specified in
    the directions for use by the manufacturer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where water-bearing cracks are to be sealed, rapid-foaming polyurethane
    shall, where necessary, be injected to provide temporary sealing prior to
    injection of the cold-curing resin. Where cement paste is used, dry or
    moist crack edges shall be wetted thoroughly.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where re-injection is required, this shall be carried out within the
    temperature-dependent period of the crack filling material given in the
    directions for use by the manufacturer. At high ambient temperatures, the
    use of cooling to influence the workability time of materials in containers
    is permissible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The injection pressure used shall be commensurate with the equipment and
    materials used, to ensure that cracks are completely filled without leaving
    voids.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Preparation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) Surface preparation shall be undertaken in accordance with Clause
    687.08.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2)
    <strong>
        Injection entry ports shall be provided along the crack at intervals of
        not greater than 200 mm.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a concrete component such as a wall or slab is cracked all the way
    through, the injection entry ports shall be located on both sides where
    access is possible. The injection entry ports at the reverse face shall be
    placed midway between those at the front.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where cracks can only be sealed on one side only, injection entry ports
    shall be placed at intervals which are 50% of the depth to which the resin
    is required to penetrate or not greater than 200 mm, whichever is the
    lesser.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (3) Apply surface seal material to the face of the crack between the entry
    ports. Surface seal material shall also be applied to the reverse face of
    cracks where accessible.
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    (iii) Resin Injection
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) For vertical cracks injection of resin adhesive shall begin at the
    lowest entry port and continue until there is an appearance of resin
    adhesive at the next entry port adjacent to the entry port being pumped.
    Where resin adhesive drains out of vertical cracks in retaining walls or
    foundation walls due to the inability to seal the earth backfill side or
    the bottom of slabs, such cracks shall be re-injected until they are full
    and remain full.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For horizontal cracks, the injection shall proceed from one end of the
    crack to the other. For horizontal cracks, which are on grade, the crack
    shall be re-injected until the crack is full to compensate for any resin
    adhesive which may drain away due to the grade.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a concrete component such as a wall or slab is cracked all the way
    through, the resin shall be injected through alternate entry ports on both
    sides where access is possible. For slabs, injection from the underside
    shall precede injection from the top.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) When resin adhesive travel is indicated by appearance at the next
    adjacent port, injection shall be discontinued and the entry port capped,
    and the resin injection shall be transferred to the next adjacent port
    where the resin adhesive has appeared.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (3) Resin adhesive injection shall be performed continuously until cracks
    are completely filled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        (4) If port to port travel of resin adhesive is not indicated, the work
        shall cease immediately and the Superintendent notified.

<p>
    (b) Execution of the works
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Filling and sealing of horizontally positioned cracks shall be executed by
    pouring and spreading suitable crack filling material onto the surface or
    placing into purposely formed reservoirs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Pouring and Spreading onto Surface
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The crack filling material shall be poured onto the surface and spread with
    brooms rollers or squeegees. The material shall be worked back and forth
    over the cracks to obtain maximum filling. Excess material shall be broomed
    off the surface to prevent slick, shining areas after curing. The feeding
    of material to the crack shall be uninterrupted, throughout the
    temperature-dependent workability of the crack filling material, until no
    more material can be absorbed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Purposely Formed Reservoir
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A reservoir shall be formed by running a bead of silicone or acrylic
    sealant along both sides of the crack. The ends of both beads shall be
    formed together at the termination of the crack to form a reservoir. The
    edge of the sealant shall be a minimum of 5 mm away from the crack and its
    height shall be a minimum of 10 mm above the substrate. The crack filling
    material shall be poured into the reservoir and be topped up as its level
    drops. When the crack filling material in the reservoir starts to gel, both
    the excess resin and the sealant reservoir shall be scraped off.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Inactive cracks with a width of less than 0.2 mm may be coated over with a
    protective coating system, provided such cracks are not associated with
    earth or water retaining concrete components. Protective coating systems
    including their mixing and application shall satisfy all requirements of
    Section 686.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Active or live cracks of width equal to or greater than 0.2 mm shall be
    repaired in accordance with Clause 687.10 prior to coating over.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Inactive or dormant cracks of width equal to or greater than 0.2 mm shall
    be repaired in accordance the requirements of this section prior to coating
    over.

    687.13 STITCHING OF CRACKS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This crack repair method shall be used where restoration of the tensile
    strength is required across major cracks. Holes shall be drilled on both
    sides of the crack, cleaned in accordance with Clause 687.08 and
    U&#8209;shaped metal legs (stitching) anchored in the holes with an epoxy
    resin based bonding system. The stitching metal legs shall be variable in
    length and orientation, and they shall be located such that the tension
    across the crack is distributed over an area in the concrete and not
    concentrated on a single plane within a section. Such cracks shall also be
    sealed in accordance with this section.

    687.16 VERIFICATION OF DEPTH OF PENETRATION OF CRACK FILLING MATERIAL
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall extract at a minimum of seven days after
        completion of crack repair works a sample of two 75 mm diameter cores
        from the first 25 m of crack repair works and thereafter for every 50 m
        or part thereof, to verify the depth of penetration of the crack
        filling material. The core samples shall be extracted at locations
        jointly determined by the Contractor and the Superintendent's
        Representative and shall be inspected by the Superintendent's
        representative, to verify that the crack filling material has
        penetrated to the full depth of the crack.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Core samples shall be located with a calibrated cover meter capable of
    detecting the presence of steel reinforcement with an accuracy of &#177;1
    mm at a depth of 25 mm, to avoid cutting through the reinforcing steel.
    Drilling cores in areas of high stress, or creating core holes below the
    waterline shall be avoided.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall obtain the approval of the Superintendent prior to
        undertaking any extraction of core samples.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    If the Contractor fails to adequately verify the depth of penetration of
    the crack filling material it shall extract additional 75 mm diameter cores
    at its own expense. Alternatively, the Contractor may at its own expense
    use non-destructive test (NDT) methods such as Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity
    (UPV), Impact Echo (IE) or Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) to
    establish the extent of penetration of resin adhesive into the cracks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall supply for review by the Superintendent a copy of all
    depth of penetration testing including photographic records within one week
    of undertaking such verification testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The cored holes shall be cleaned and repaired with a suitable shrinkage
    compensating cementitious repair material in accordance with the
    requirements of Section 689. The exposed surface of the repaired hole shall
    be similar in texture and colour to the surrounding concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    Should the crack filling material not penetrate the full depth of the
    crack, the Contractor shall carry out rectification works. These works
    shall achieve the specified level of durability, otherwise the concrete
    works represented by that sample may be rejected.
