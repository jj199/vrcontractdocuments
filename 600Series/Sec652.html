    652.01 GENERAL
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the manufacture and supply of laminated elastomeric
    bearings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The manufacture and supply of elastomeric bearings shall be in accordance
    with AS 5100.4 Bridge design: Bearings and deck joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    652.02 MATERIALS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Materials and components for use in bearings shall comply with AS 5100.4
    Bridge design: Bearings and deck joints.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The completed bearings shall satisfy the structural performance and
    dimensional requirements of the design.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    652.03 TOLERANCES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Dimensional tolerances for bearings shall be in accordance with AS 5100.4
    Bridge design: Bearings and deck joints Appendix C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    652.04 BEARING TESTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bearings shall comply with the testing requirements of AS 5100.4 Bridge
    design: Bearings and deck joints and shall be tested in accordance with
    Appendix D.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bearings shall be tested in compression and examined for splits, uneven
    bulging, delamination and other irregularity of shape.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Bearings that are split or which exhibit uneven bulging, delamination
        or other irregularity of shape shall be rejected.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Representative samples of bearings shall be subjected to shear stiffness
    testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Elastomeric bearings that do not meet shear stiffness testing criteria
        shall be rejected.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Copies of all test certificates shall be provided to the
        Superintendent for review.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    652.05 TRACEABILITY
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bearings shall be marked with a unique identification number and with the
    AS part number as listed in AS 5100.4 Bridge design: Bearings and deck
    joints Appendix A.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    It shall be possible to identify bearings with the batch number of the
    elastomer and the associated test certificate number via the unique
    identification number.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bearings shall be traceable from the point of manufacture to their final
    location via the unique identification number.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Copies of all traceability documents shall be provided to the
        Superintendent for review.

<p>
    652.06 HANDLING, PACKING AND STORAGE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Elastomeric bearings shall be transported, stored and handled in a manner
    that prevents damage to the bearings. Bearings that are damaged shall be
    rejected.
