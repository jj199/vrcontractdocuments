    Excavation shall consist of all clearing and grubbing necessary to clear
    the way for proposed excavations, the excavation of foundation pits or
    interiors of cofferdams or cylinders, the preparation of foundation, and
    shall include all sheeting and bracing, drainage, pumping or bailing, and
    other necessary work and materials.

    602.02 TIMBERING AND SUPPORT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For excavations in soil or in rock containing unfavourable jointing,
    bedding or weak seams, which are deeper than 1.5 m the Contractor shall
    provide adequate support or benching to prevent collapse of excavation
    faces and/or heaving of excavation base. Works shall be undertaken in
    accordance with all relevant Acts, Regulations and Codes and in particular
    the Occupational Health and Safety Act..
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        For excavations adjacent to railway property, alongside roadways, in or
        alongside waterways, and excavations deeper than 1.5 m, the Contractor
        shall submit to the Superintendent for review detailed drawings of
        bracing and/or sheeting proposals, including design calculations and
        methods of construction and removal, not less than 10 business days
        prior to excavation commencing.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For excavations carried out adjacent to railway property, obtaining
    approval of the appropriate railway authority and rail entities shall be
    the responsibility of the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    <strong>
        No excavation adjacent to railway property shall commence without the
        approval of the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All works and the quality of all materials used for the temporary support
    of excavations shall conform with the appropriate Australian Standards.

    602.03 EXCAVATION PREPARATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water shall not be permitted to remain in the bottom of excavations during
    construction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The quality of the material (rock or soil) exposed in the side walls and at
    the bottom of the excavation shall be inspected by a geotechnical
    consultant with suitable experience to confirm that the material is of the
    type and quality indicated on the drawings. All loose material and pockets
    of unsound material, mud and/or water shall be removed to expose the
    foundation material being of the type and quality indicated on the
    drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The bottoms of excavations shall be trimmed in horizontal beds or steps.
    The steps shall have maximum vertical rise height to horizontal run length
    of 1 to 5 ratio.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the excavation is for construction of footings, the sides of footings
    shall be formed in accordance with Section 614 - Formwork. The Contractor
    may dispense with formwork for the sides of the footing if all unsupported
    faces of the excavation are inspected by a geotechnical consultant who
    confirms the material exposed in the unsupported faces has the material
    strength to maintain the stability of the faces without external (e.g.
    formwork) or internal support (e.g. soil nailing).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where concrete is cast against an unformed surface, an extra 25 mm cover
    shall be provided to the reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The bottom of any excavation which has been disturbed by the action of
    water or any construction activity such that it does not meet the
    specification requirement shall be rectified by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>HP</strong>
    <strong>
        Blinding, sealing or foundation concrete shall not be placed until the
        bottom of the excavation has been reviewed by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Within 24 hours of a request from the Superintendent, the geotechnical
    inspection reports shall be submitted to the Superintendent for review.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide appropriate facilities for the inspection of
    all work and shall be responsible for all costs associated with the
    provision of such facilities and the engagement of a geotechnical
    consultant who shall be pre-qualified with VicRoads.
