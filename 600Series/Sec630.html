<p>
    The extent of non&#8209;destructive inspection using methods of
    radiography, ultrasonics, magnetic particle, or liquid penetrant shall be
    in accordance with Table 630.181.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All welds shall comply with the acceptance limits for imperfections in
    welds given in Table 6.2 or Table 6.3 of AS/NZS 1554 Part 1. Lengths of
    weld containing imperfections exceeding the limits in Table 6.3 of AS/NZS
    1554 Part 1 shall be repaired. The repair procedure shall be submitted to
    the Superintendent for review for at least three working days prior to
    commencement of repair work. The full lengths of repaired weld shall be
    re-inspected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the total of defective portions exceeds 10% of the weld length
    inspected, the total weld length for that weld detail shall be inspected.
    <p>
    </p>

    630.20 BOLTING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bolts and associated nuts and washers shall comply with the appropriate
    bolt material standard specified on the drawings. Bolts, nuts and washers
    for Property Class 4.6/S bolting shall be supplied in accordance with AS
    1111 and AS 1112. Bolts, nuts and washers for Property Class 8.8 bolting
    shall be supplied in accordance with AS/NZS 1252.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All material within the grip of the bolt shall be steel and no compressible
    material shall be permitted within the grip. Each bolt and nut shall be
    assembled with at least one washer. One washer shall be provided under the
    rotated part.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Locknuts, when specified, shall be placed between the main nut and the
    components being gripped.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The length of a bolt shall extend entirely through the nuts and be such
    that at least one clear thread shows beyond the nut, but not more than 12
    mm beyond the nut. The shank shall be threaded to such a length that not
    less than one thread shall be within the grip of the bolt after tightening.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bolts and nuts shall have a protective coating, unless otherwise
    specified. The coating on hot-dip galvanized bolts and nuts shall comply
    with AS 1214. The coating on hot-dip galvanized washers shall comply with
    AS/NZS 4680.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where bearing faces of bolted parts are not parallel and exceed a taper of
    1:20, a suitably tapered washer shall be provided against the tapered
    surface and placed under the non&#8209;rotating component where possible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Preparation of Surfaces in Contact
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All oil, dirt, loose scale, loose rust, burrs, fins and any other defects
    on the surfaces of contact, that will prevent solid seating of the parts in
    the snug-tight condition, shall be removed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For a friction-type connection, the contact surfaces shall be clean
    as-rolled surfaces or equivalent and, in addition to satisfying the
    provisions above, shall be free from paint, lacquer, galvanizing or other
    applied finish unless the applied finish has been tested to establish the
    friction coefficient or slip factor. Values of slip factor for clean steel
    surfaces and abrasive blasted surfaces coated with zinc silicate coating
    are given in AS 5100 Part 6. Slip factor for other surfaces shall be
    evaluated in accordance with the standard test in AS 5100 Part 6.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Assembly and Alignment of Connections to Snug Tight Condition
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each part of the structure shall be aligned as soon as practicable after
    erection. Permanent connections shall not be made until sufficient of the
    structure has been aligned, levelled, plumbed and temporarily connected to
    ensure that members will not be displaced during subsequent erection or
    alignment of the remainder of the structure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Hardened or plate washers shall be used under both the bolt head and nut
    for any slotted and oversize holes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During assembly, drifting shall not enlarge the holes or distort the metal.
    Holes which do not match shall be reamed or drilled, and if necessary bolts
    of a larger diameter shall be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolting categories 4.6/S and 8.8/S shall be installed to the snug-tight
    condition to ensure that the load-transmitting plates are brought into
    effective contact. Snug-tight is the tightness attained by a few impacts of
    an impact wrench or by the full effort of a person using a standard podger
    spanner.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All workshop-assembled joints should be match marked before the structure
    is dismantled.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Assembly of a Connection Involving Tensioned Bolts
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This sub-clause applies to bolting categories 8.8/TB and 8.8/TF.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolts, nuts and washers shall be supplied in accordance with AS/NZS 1252.
    They shall be placed so that the marks identifying a high strength fastener
    are visible after tightening.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Nuts for high strength bolts shall be of the double faced or washer faced
    hexagon type.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolts and nuts shall always be tightened in accordance with a prescribed
    sequence. Where the sequence is not shown on the drawings a staggered
    pattern shall be adopted with tightening proceeding from the centre of the
    joint out towards the free edges.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bolt heads and nuts shall be tightened and the nuts shall be effectively
    locked where specified.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    High strength structural bolts that are to be tensioned may be used
    temporarily during erection to facilitate the assembly. However, if so
    used, they shall not be finally and fully tensioned until all bolts in the
    connection have been snug-tightened in the correct sequence.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The slackening off and re&#8209;tensioning of fully&#8209;tightened bolts
    is not permitted. Bolts shall not be re&#8209;used. Adjusting tension of
    previously tensioned bolts that may have been loosened by the tensioning of
    adjacent bolts is not considered as re&#8209;tensioning
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Method of Tensioning
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All bolts shall be tightened either by the 'part&#8209;turn' method or by
    the use of a direct&#8209;tension indicator device to produce, on
    completion of the joint, to not less than the minimum bolt tension
    appropriate to the particular bolt diameter as specified in Table 630.201.
