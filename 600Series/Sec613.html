    613.05 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Falsework shall be designed to withstand all forces resulting from the
    loads as specified in this clause or from the loads specified in AS 3610
    and AS 1170 Parts 1 and 2, whichever produces the greater effect, and any
    additional loads that may be imposed on the falsework during construction.
    The design shall take into account the magnitude, direction and duration of
    these forces individually and collectively to ensure that on completion of
    the permanent structural components, the line, levels and dimensions of the
    constructed component comply with the requirements of the Contract.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The design loads (other than those specified in AS 3610 and AS 1170) shall
    be:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Dead Load
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This shall include the mass of forms, falsework, wet concrete,
    reinforcement and any other embedded material. The density of wet concrete,
    including reinforcement, shall be taken as 2700 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Superimposed Load
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This shall include the mass of workmen, plant, equipment and runways,
    stacked material and an impact allowance equal to 25% of the all up weight
    of any mechanically operated plant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In no case shall the superimposed load be less than 2 kPa (plus the mass of
    stacked material) on the plan area of the finished concrete or a single
    isolated load of 2.5 kN applied at any point of the structure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Wind Load
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This shall be 2.4 kPa minimum acting on the exposed area of falsework,
    formwork and any object supported by the falsework or formwork.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Other Loads
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    These shall include any special conditions likely to occur during
    construction, including the redistribution of load due to the effects of
    prestressing or early application of prestress, construction stages and
    staged removal of falsework. The falsework design shall also allow where
    required the effects of stream flow, traffic impact, flooding and any other
    applicable conditions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Horizontal Loading
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This shall include wind loading, horizontal surge loading equal to 25% of
    the all up mass of any mechanically operated plant and loading occurring
    during construction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    In no case shall the design value of the horizontal load acting in any
    direction be less than 1.5 kN per metre applied at the edge of deck or 3%
    of the total dead load, whichever is the greater.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The design of all falsework members and connections shall comply with AS
    3610, AS 4100 and AS 1720.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Guardrailing and access requirements shall comply with AS 1576.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Falsework members shall be designed and constructed to limit deflections to
    prevent cracking or settlement of previously cast sections due to
    subsequent casts. Deflections of beams and dimensional changes in other
    members and connections shall be limited to ensure that the finished
    concrete is within the specified tolerances for line and level.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All permanent structural components which are adjacent to or surrounded by
    falsework shall be protected to prevent any damage during the execution of
    the works.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Falsework shall not be supported or braced from completed permanent
    structural components unless it can be demonstrated that such temporary
    loading will not affect the structural integrity of the relevant component
    or the stability and integrity of the overall falsework system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall carry out a site specific geotechnical investigation
    in addition to the geotechnical investigation required for the design of
    the permanent structure, to establish the appropriateness of the existing
    ground conditions for the design and construction of the falsework system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the falsework settles under load such that the allowable dimensional
    tolerances on the permanent structural components are exceeded, a
    non-conformance shall be raised and the falsework shall be modified such
    that the finished permanent structural components comply with the
    requirements of the Contract with regard to dimension, position and
    tolerances.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required, the falsework design shall include hydrologic and hydraulic
    design parameters to assess the potential for scour and bank erosion and
    allow for suitable protective measures.

    613.06 FALSEWORK DRAWINGS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The drawings submitted to the Superintendent shall state all design
    assumptions and shall include a statement of the loads and any dimensional
    changes due to loading in all members of the falsework. The drawings shall
    be fully detailed including all member sizes and materials, dimensions,
    levels, erection procedures and other relevant details including bracing,
    connections and foundations, to ensure that erection and inspection of the
    falsework can be undertaken without reference to any other documentation.

<p>
    The falsework shall have provision for making adjustment to level.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    613.08 PROVISION FOR LONGITUDINAL AND LATERAL MOVEMENTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The structural members of the falsework shall be designed for loads which
    may result from longitudinal or lateral movements caused by temperature
    effects or shrinkage of concrete. Alternatively, provision shall be
    incorporated in the falsework to permit these movements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    613.09 BRACING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Adequate bracing shall be provided longitudinally and transversely to
    ensure that the falsework is stable and that significant horizontal
    movements resulting from the applied loads are limited.
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    613.10 FOUNDATIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The foundations of the falsework shall be designed to prevent excessive
    settlement and rotation of supports and to ensure that the tolerances for
    the finished structure are satisfied. Individual footings and groups of
    footings shall be designed also to satisfy stability criteria. Where the
    foundation material may become saturated with water, allowance shall be
    made for possible reduction in bearing capacity, consequent changes in
    stability, and increased settlement or heave of the foundation. Bearing
    surfaces of footings shall be horizontal. Footings shall not be founded
    directly on filled ground.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    613.11 FALSEWORK AT ABUTMENT BATTERS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Footings for falsework shall not be founded directly on abutment fills.
    Footings on cut batters will only be permitted if the stability of the
    individual footings or groups of footings on the cut slope, and the
    stability of the cut slope as a whole, are adequate and incorporate the
    normal safety factors against possible failure.

<p>
</p>
<p>
    B. the strength, stability and serviceability and other Limit State
    requirements as defined in the Principal's Project Requirements are met;
    and
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    C. the construction drawings and specifications accurately describe the
    following matters critical to the structural integrity -
