    (j) Limitations on Drying Shrinkage
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    One sample per trial mix shall be taken. Each sample shall consist of 3
    specimens tested in accordance with AS 1012.13. The shrinkage strain of
    each sample, as determined from the average value of the 3 specimens, shall
    not exceed 550 microstrain and 750 microstrain after 21 days and 56 days of
    drying respectively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For concrete grades with minimum 28 day compressive strength in the range
    of 60 MPa to less than 80 MPa the shrinkage strain shall not exceed 500
    microstrain and 700 microstrain after 21 days and 56 days of drying
    respectively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For concrete grades with minimum 28 day compressive strength in the range
    of 80 MPa to 100 MPa the shrinkage strain shall not exceed 400 microstrain
    and 600 microstrain after 21 days and 56 days of drying respectively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Drying shrinkage requirements for special applications shall be as
    specified in the drawings and specification.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Chloride&#8209;ion Content
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The maximum acid&#8209;soluble chloride&#8209;ion content of concrete as
    placed, expressed as the percentage of the total mass of cementitious
    material in the concrete mix shall not be greater than:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; 0.1% for prestressed concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; 0.15% for reinforced concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; 0.07% for all mortars and grouts, including post&#8209;tensioning
    grout.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Sulphate Content
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The sulphate content of concrete as placed, expressed as the percentage by
    mass of acid&#8209;soluble SO3 to the total cementitious material in the
    concrete mix shall not be greater than 5%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the requirements of this clause the sulphate content for
    steam and heat accelerated cured concrete, expressed as the percentage by
    mass of acid&#8209;soluble SO<sub>3</sub> to the total cementitious
    material in the concrete mix shall not be greater than 4%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sulphate and chloride&#8209;ion content shall be determined by testing of
    hardened concrete in accordance with AS 1012.20.1.

<p>
    (l) Testing and Acceptance of Concrete Mix Design on the Basis of 28 Day
    VPV Value
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Test cylinders shall be cured in accordance with AS 1012. A minimum of 2
    cylinders per sample per trial mix shall be taken. Each cylinder shall be
    tested for VPV at 28 days in accordance with test method AS 1012.21. The
    specification will be satisfied if the VPV value for each sample, as
    determined from the average value of the test cylinders, is not greater
    than the specified maximum 28 day VPV value in Table 610.061.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should the VPV value of any one sample representing the concrete exceed the
    specified maximum 28 day VPV value as shown in Table 610.061, the
    Contractor shall take steps to modify the concrete mix design and
    re&#8209;test to ensure that the maximum specified VPV value is not
    exceeded.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Description
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The fine aggregate shall consist of clean, hard, durable, naturally
    occurring sands, or a combination of naturally occurring sands and
    manufactured sands, and shall be free from clay, dust, lumps, soft or flaky
    particles, shale, salt, alkali, organic matter, soil or other deleterious
    substances. Any manufactured sands used as fine aggregate shall be crushed
    from rock that produces aggregate complying with the requirements of clause
    610.11. Manufactured sands produced from any igneous or metamorphic rock
    shall have a Degradation Factor &#8209; Crusher Fines of not less than 60.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        A maximum of 25% of manufactured sand from a source approved by the
        Superintendent will be permitted.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Consideration may be given by the Superintendent to approve the use of up
    to a maximum of 50% of manufactured sand if objective documented evidence
    is provided that concrete made with such higher amount of manufactured sand
    complies with all other requirements of this section both in the fresh and
    hardened state, including evidence of acceptable performance regarding
    tendency for segregation, bleeding, plastic shrinkage, satisfactory
    compaction and finishing properties.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Testing for Impurities
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Fine aggregate shall be tested for impurities in accordance with AS 1141.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The clay and fine silt levels of natural sands shall be monitored as a
        routine quality control measure and records shall be available for
        review by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    Action shall be taken where levels exceed normal consistency limits derived
    from routine quality control testing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Grading of Fine Aggregate
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Fine aggregate shall be uniformly graded and shall comply with the limits
    in Table 610.111 when tested with standard sieves.
    <p>
    </p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (v) Use of Pebble Aggregate
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the requirements of clause 610.11(d) and Section 801,
    pebble aggregate may be used in the manufacture of structural concrete
    including concrete intended for use in pre-stressed and post-tensioned
    members subject to the following requirements:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) where the LA of pebble aggregate or blended aggregate containing
    pebbles is greater than 35 but equal to or less than 45 the Wet and Dry
    Strength variation shall be equal to or less than 25 and the Sodium
    Sulphate Soundness shall be equal to or less than 8
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) pebble aggregate or blended aggregate containing pebbles with an LA
    greater than 45 shall not be used in the works
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (3) the minimum frequency of testing for Wet and Dry Strength and Sodium
    Sulphate Soundness shall be in accordance with the requirements of Table
    610.121.

    (e) Alkali Aggregate Reactivity
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Unless otherwise approved by the Superintendent, all aggregates shall
        be assessed and tested for alkali reactivity as follows:
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Petrographic Examination
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregates shall be assessed for any unstable silica minerals by
    petrographic examination in accordance with ASTM Test Method C295.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Potential Alkali Silica Reactivity
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The potential alkali silica reactivity of the coarse and fine aggregates
    shall be determined using either the VicRoads accelerated mortar bar test
    method RC 376.03 or the VicRoads concrete prism test method RC 376.04 as
    described in the VicRoads Code of Practice RC 500.16.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) Accelerated Mortar Bar Test Method (RC 376.03)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Coarse and fine aggregates shall be deemed to be non&#8209;reactive if the
    average expansion of the mortar bars made with the proposed aggregates and
    General Purpose portland cement Type GP does not exceed 0.1% at 21 days in
    the case of coarse aggregates and 0.15% at 21 days in the case of fine
    aggregates. Individual results shall not differ from the mean by more than
    15%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should the average expansion of the mortar bars exceed 0.1% at 21 days in
    the case of coarse aggregates and 0.15% at 21 days in the case of fine
    aggregates, the aggregates will be classed as reactive and either new
    aggregates shall be proposed for use and re&#8209;tested for compliance, or
    if it is proposed to use aggregates that have been classed as reactive, all
    of the following requirements shall be satisfied:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; the concrete mix be designed such that the alkali content does not
    exceed 2.8 kg/m<sup>3</sup> (Na<sub>2</sub>O equivalent)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#8226; a blended cement be used in the concrete mix that satisfies the
    minimum requirements of Table 610.112. Concrete mixes containing the
    minimum proportions of supplementary cementitious material as shown in
    Table 610.112 shall be deemed to comply with this clause.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) Concrete Prism Test Method (RC 376.04)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregates shall be classified reactive when the average expansion at 12
    months is greater than 0.03%, and non reactive when it is equal to or less
    than 0.03%.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Aggregates classified as reactive by the concrete prism test method in a
    concrete mix design, shall not be used in that particular concrete mix
    design. Alternative aggregates and/or alternative concrete mix designs
    shall be used subject to compliance with the requirements of this
    specification.

    610.13 MANUFACTURE AND DELIVERY OF PREMIXED CONCRETE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for the manufacture and delivery of all
    concrete which shall comply with the approved or registered concrete mix
    design and the requirements of AS 1379.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum quantity of a load of premixed concrete in the mixer or
    agitator delivered to site shall be 1 m<sup>3</sup>. The quantity of
    concrete delivered in any mixer or agitator shall not exceed the rated
    capacity of the agitator drum.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall not be mixed when the air temperature is lower than 5&#176;C
    or greater than 35&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water may be added to the freshly mixed concrete prior to commencement of
    discharge provided no more than 60 minutes have elapsed from the time of
    adding cement to the aggregate and a means of accurately measuring the
    volume of water is available to ensure that the maximum design amount of
    water and the agreed maximum W/C ratio are not exceeded. In addition,
    concrete samples shall be taken after the water has been added, in
    accordance with clause 610.16(b). The consistency of the concrete shall be
    measured by a slump test after the water has been added, in accordance with
    clause 610.16(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No water shall be added after the commencement of discharge of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete which has begun to stiffen shall not be used in the works.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Concrete which has been dried&#8209;out after leaving the mixing plant
    shall not be used in the works. Notwithstanding this requirement concrete
    may be dried&#8209;out after leaving the mixing plant provided the site of
    intended discharge is located within a close proximity to the mixing plant,
    to ensure the maximum discharge time of 60 minutes as stated in clause
    610.13(f) from the time of original mixing of the concrete is not exceeded
    and quality documentation is provided to verify that the affected load of
    concrete fully complies with this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to the discharge of concrete at the site, the mixer or agitator shall
    be operated at mixing speed until the concrete achieves the required
    uniformity but for not less than a period of three minutes. Where
    superplasticisers or other admixtures are added to the concrete on site,
    the concrete shall be mixed for a period of not less than five minutes
    prior to the discharge at the site
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Self Compacting Concrete (SCC)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Further to the requirements of clause 610.07, SCC shall incorporate the
    various cementitious materials, coarse and fine aggregate and any
    additional fine materials, water and chemical admixtures in proportions to
    achieve the rheological characteristics of flow and self-compaction. SCC
    shall be produced using High Range Polycarboxylate Type Water Reducers
    which include a viscosity modifying capability that impart psuedoplastic or
    thixotropic behaviour upon the concrete in order to inhibit segregation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Conventional superplasticisers may be used provided a viscosity modifying
    admixture is also used and it is clearly demonstrated that the required
    flow is being achieved without segregation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    SCC shall not be vibrated or subjected to any physical disturbance after
    deposition.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The slump flow, T500 time (measure of viscosity) and passing ability of the
    self compacting concrete (SCC) shall be determined in accordance with the
    AS 1012.3.5. The slump flow, T500 time and passing ability of the SCC shall
    comply with the requirements of Table 610.131.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sampling and testing for SCC shall be in accordance with the requirements
    of clause 610.16(n).

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All concrete shall be sampled and tested in accordance with AS 1012 unless
    otherwise specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Each sample of concrete shall be tested for compressive strength, slump,
    air entrainment (when required), slump flow, T500 time and passing ability
    (when SCC is used), VPV value, drying shrinkage and soluble salts (at
    concrete mix design stage), as specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Frequency of Sampling and Testing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Whenever concrete is being cast in a structural member or a portion of it
    in one continuous casting operation, the minimum number of test samples
    shall be in accordance with Table 610.161.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A continuous casting operation is one in which the maximum time interval
    between the end of discharge of one truckload of concrete and the beginning
    of discharge of the next truckload does not exceed 45 minutes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Whenever a group of structural members is being cast in separate
    operations, where the time interval between the end of discharge of one
    truckload of concrete and the beginning of discharge of the next truckload
    exceeds 45 minutes, the minimum number of test samples shall be one (1) per
    truckload of concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Samples shall be taken at the point of discharge prior to placement in a
    random and representative manner and at approximately equal portions of the
    volume of concrete cast in one continuous operation. Unless otherwise
    specified in this section or directed by the Superintendent, no sampling
    shall be undertaken from consecutive truckloads of concrete cast in one
    continuous operation.

        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        After satisfying this requirement, the Contractor may then make a
        submission to the Superintendent for agreement to reduce the frequency
        of slump testing of superplasticised concrete to be in accordance with
        Table 610.161, provided a high level of process control, including a
        high level of control of total water content in the mix in accordance
        with specified requirements, is supported with objective documented
        evidence.

    610.161 and any batch fails to achieve the specified standard, the
    Contractor shall test all subsequent batches of superplasticised concrete

<p>
    For the purpose of determining the actual slump of superplasticised

</p>
<p>
    If the measured slump is not within the limits specified in Table 610.162,
    one repeat test shall be made immediately from another portion of the same
    sample. If the value obtained from the repeat test falls within the limits
    given in Table 610.162, the concrete represented by the sample shall be
    deemed to comply with the appropriate nominated mix design slump, otherwise
    it shall be rejected.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    The slump of the concrete shall be checked and recorded within 45 minutes
    of adding cement to the aggregate, or immediately prior to discharge when
    the actual haul time exceeds 45 minutes and/or when water is added to the
    mixed batch in accordance with clause 610.13(a).

    the members or in the test cylinder heating box respectively for the
    duration of the curing cycle as specified in clause 610.23(g) and clause
    610.23(h). Following the steam curing cycle curing of the cylinders shall
    continue in accordance with the requirements of AS 1012.

    (f) Compression Testing Prior to Application of Prestress
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    For post&#8209;tensioned concrete members, the post&#8209;tensioning force
    shall only be applied when two cylinders per sample are tested and the
    average compressive strength of these cylinders is equal to or greater than
    the specified compressive strength as shown on the drawings, and the lower
    cylinder result is greater than 90% of the specified compressive strength.

</p>
<p>
    In the event that the above requirements are not satisfied, application of
    prestress shall be deferred until such time as the compressive strength of
    an additional cylinder per sample achieves the specified compressive
    strength for pre&#8209;tensioned concrete or the cylinders tested at 28
    days satisfy the requirements of clause 610.16(g) for post&#8209;tensioned
    concrete.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Superintendent may at his discretion require additional VPV testing and
    compressive strength testing to be undertaken from the remainder of the
    fresh concrete supply or the in situ hardened concrete or both, as
    described below.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Fresh Concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the compressive strength requirements as specified in this
    section, additional samples of concrete as detailed in clause 610.16(b) and
    Table 610.161 of at least two cylinders shall be tested for VPV at 28 days,
    in accordance with test method AS 1012.21. The specification will be
    satisfied if the VPV value for each sample, as determined from the average
    value of the additional test cylinders, does not exceed the specified
    maximum 28 day VPV value in Table 610.061.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should the VPV value of any one sample representing the concrete exceed the
    specified maximum 28 day VPV value as shown in Table 610.061, the
    Contractor shall modify the concrete mix design and undertake other
    measures as required at its own expense, to satisfy the specification
    requirements for subsequent concrete supply by further sampling and
    testing. The hardened concrete represented by the samples shall be subject
    to rejection, rectification by the Contractor, the requirements as
    described below, or as determined by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Hardened Concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the requirements of clause 610.16(g)(ii) for compressive
    strength of test cores, a minimum of two cores per sample shall be cut from
    the relevant completed structural member, portion of member or group of
    members represented by a set of test cylinder sample(s) and tested at 28
    days. Each core shall be 75 mm diameter x 150 mm long, cut transversely
    into two equal slices and tested for VPV at 28 days in accordance with test
    method AS 1012.21. The VPV value for each core shall be determined from the
    average value of the test slices.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For members where the thickness is less than 150 mm the core length shall
    be the full thickness of the member. The specification will be satisfied if
    the VPV value for each sample, as determined from the average value of the
    test cores, does not exceed the specified maximum VPV value at 28 days as
    shown in Table 610.061.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All cores shall be clearly labelled to identify them with the structural
    member and location they represent. Testing shall be undertaken to ensure
    that the core locations are remote from the existing steel reinforcement.
    Where cores are cut from concrete decks and slabs, core locations shall be
    remote from wheel paths. Cores containing steel reinforcement shall not be
    tested.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Core locations shall be submitted for approval by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    For coring from prestressed concrete the requirements of clause 610.16
    shall be satisfied.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the VPV value of any one sample representing the concrete exceeds the
    specified maximum 28 day VPV value as shown in Table 610.061, the
    Contractor shall carry out rectification works. These works shall achieve
    the specified level of durability, otherwise the concrete represented by
    that sample may be rejected.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Non-destructive tests may be used to investigate non-conforming
        concrete of observed or suspect quality subject to approval by the
        Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (k) Testing and Acceptance of Concrete on the Basis of 28 Day VPV Value
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the requirements of clause 610.16(j), where a concrete pour
    exceeds 50 m3 a sample consisting of at least two cylinders shall be
    sampled at the point of discharge and tested for VPV at 28 days, in
    accordance with test method AS 1012.21.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For concrete structures located in marine and other saline environments or
    which are subject to sulphate and chemical attack at least two cylinders
    per sample shall be tested for VPV at 28 days as detailed in clause
    610.16(b) and Table 610.161.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Should the VPV value of any one sample representing the concrete exceed the
    specified maximum 28 day VPV value as shown in Table 610.061, the concrete
    represented by that sample and subsequent concrete supply shall be subject
    to the requirements of clause 610.16(j) for testing and acceptance of
    non-conforming concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (l) Determination of early age compressive strength
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where early application of loading or early removal of formwork is
    proposed, or where concrete is to be placed over or adjacent to and
    connected with a previous section prior to achieving the minimum 7 day
    compressive strength, additional test cylinder(s) per sample shall be taken
    for the assessment of early age compressive strength.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall nominate the total number of cylinder(s) per sample in
    excess of the minimum number of cylinders specified in clause 610.16(d).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Further to the requirements of clause 610.16(e), when additional test
    cylinder(s) per sample above the specified minimum number are taken to vary
    a requirement of this specification, such as early application of loading
    or early removal of formwork, the test cylinder(s) shall be cured with the
    concrete member under conditions no more favourable than the most
    unfavourable conditions for the portion of the concrete which the test
    cylinders represent. Test cylinders shall not be moved or transported to
    the laboratory for testing prior to 18 hours from moulding in accordance
    with the requirements of clause 9.2.2 of AS 1012.8.1.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the early age compressive strength requirements of this
    sub-clause 610.16(l), the Contractor shall also comply with the curing
    requirements of clause 610.23 and the minimum curing period requirements as
    stated in Table 610.231.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Further to the requirements of clause 610.16(d) and clause 610.16(e)
        various types of maturity testing and TMC may be used to determine the
        early age in situ strength development of concrete over a required time
        period for the purpose of facilitating early
    </strong>
    <strong>
        formwork removal, lifting precast units out of moulds or early
        application of loading, subject to the approval of the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Based on the specific application, a proposed maturity method or TMC of
        assessing early in situ strength shall be submitted for review by the
        Superintendent.
    </strong>
    Each proposal shall be supported with a documented detailed methodology and
    documented evidence of previous performance including accuracy in
    determining the in situ strength development of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The proposed method of maturity testing or TMC shall include:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) the type of equipment to be used to monitor the in situ temperatures,
    or the control temperatures for TMC for the specific concrete mix and
    prevailing curing conditions:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) for maturity testing - to develop a maturity curve (correlation between
    compressive strength and maturity)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) for TMC - to monitor the heat development in the in situ concrete which
    heats the water in the TMC system and matches the temperature of the in
    situ concrete with the temperature of the cylinders in the TMC system to
    facilitate strength development
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) method of recording the time/temperature relationship including the
    type of data loggers
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) the period of monitoring
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) the proposed number and location of temperature sensors to be used
    which shall include as a minimum the interior and near surface of the
    concrete member.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The maturity curve shall be updated as a minimum on a 3 monthly basis or
    earlier to allow for any changes in materials, in concrete mix
    proportioning, the performance of mixing equipment and construction
    conditions to ensure the ongoing validity of the maturity curve.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The maturity curve shall also be verified at the commencement of maturity
    testing and subsequently on a 3 monthly basis as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) compare the early age strengths of test cylinders sampled and tested in
    accordance with clause 610.16 during construction, with the maturity curve;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) monitor the maturity of an additional early age strength test cylinder
    per sample, sampled in accordance with clause 610.16, during construction
    and compare the strength with the maturity curve.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall maintain records of all maturity testing to
    demonstrate compliance with the specified requirements of this section.
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall ensure that the records are available for review

</p>
<p>
    Sampling and testing for SCC to demonstrate compliance with the
    requirements of Table 610.131 shall be in accordance with clause 610.16,
    except that the slump flow, T<sub>500</sub> (measure of viscosity) and
    passing ability of SCC shall be sampled and tested at the same frequency as
    superplasticised concrete, as stated in clause 610.16(c).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    When making test cylinders for SCC the test sample shall be placed into the
    cylinder moulds from a height not exceeding 100 mm from the top of the
    mould. The placing of the concrete into the moulds shall be done in one
    continuous motion. With the exception of light tapping of the sides of

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for measuring and recording the air
    temperature, relative humidity, concrete temperature and wind velocity
    (measured one metre above the as placed concrete) at the point of concrete
    placement from commencement of placing the concrete and continue until
    curing has commenced. This information shall be used in conjunction with
    Figure 610.171 to determine the rate of evaporation of water from the
    freshly placed and unprotected surface of the concrete. The rate of
    evaporation shall be monitored by the Contractor until such time as curing
    commences.
    <p>
    </p>

    metres, suitable tremie pipes, chutes or other concreting devices shall be
    used to place the concrete to prevent segregation. Concrete shall not be
    moved horizontally by the use of vibrators.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be supplied at an adequate rate in a continuous operation to
    ensure that all the concrete in the forms can be kept plastic until placed
    in its final position and compacted, and all temporarily exposed surfaces
    covered by and knit in with fresh concrete so that no cold joints are
    formed. Equipment and personnel shall be adequate to maintain the rate of
    concrete placement adopted.
    <p>

    (c) Placing Concrete in Bored Piles, Under Water and in Dry Bores
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall submit the procedure for placing concrete in bored
        piles, under water and in dry bores, for review by the Superintendent
        at least four weeks prior to concreting.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Concrete shall not be placed in bored piles, under water or in a dry
        bore until the proposed method of placement of concrete has been
        approved by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    The minimum concrete grade for concrete placed in bored piles, under water
    or in dry bores shall be VR400/40, in accordance with the requirements of
    this section. The proposed mix shall be either a self compacting concrete
    (SCC) or a highly workable concrete as specified in clauses 610.13(b) and
    610.13(c) respectively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Highly workable concrete shall be compacted in accordance with the
    requirements of this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Placing of concrete in bored piles, underwater or in a dry bore shall be
    carried out in one continuous operation by tremie methods in accordance
    with Section 606. Concrete shall not be placed in water which has a
    temperature of less than 5&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unsound or contaminated areas of exposed concrete shall be removed and the
    surface thoroughly prepared in accordance with clause 610.20 prior to
    subsequent placement of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where cofferdams or cylinders have been sealed by underwater placement of
    concrete, dewatering shall not proceed until at least 48 hours after
    completion of concrete placement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Compaction, Screeding and Finishing of Concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Compaction
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Care shall be taken during compaction to fill every part of the forms or
    excavations, to force the concrete under and around the reinforcement and
    any other embedded fixtures without displacing them, to work coarse
    aggregate back from the face, and to remove air bubbles and voids.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall be deposited in horizontal layers not more than 350 mm thick
    except in the manufacture of prestressed concrete members. For prestressed
    members the concrete shall be built up to the full depth of the section and
    the concrete face moved forward progressively. For prestressed concrete
    members over 600 mm deep this may occur in two or three passes.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During and immediately after placing, the concrete shall be effectively
    compacted by internal vibrators of adequate size, number and frequency and
    supplemented as required by external form vibrators. A minimum of two
    internal vibrators shall be provided at any time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Vibration shall be applied to the full depth of each layer and extended
    into the top 100 mm of the underlying layer. Vibration shall continue at
    each point until air bubbles cease to emerge from the concrete, then
    withdrawn slowly to avoid leaving a defect. Concrete shall not be vibrated
    to the point where segregation of the ingredients occurs.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Internal vibrators shall be inserted vertically at successive locations at
    spacings not exceeding the manufacturer's stated zone of influence, and
    shall not be allowed to rest on the steel reinforcement, embedded fixtures
    or formwork.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Vibration shall not be applied either directly or through the reinforcement
    to any concrete which has taken its initial set
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete decks or slabs shall be compacted by internal vibrators and
    vibrating screeds such that uniform consolidation is achieved throughout
    the deck and slab area.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Where approved by the Superintendent proprietary power vibrating
        screeds of suitable widths may be used in narrow or constricted areas
        or where required by the deck and slab layout, with each new vibrating
        run overlapping the previous one by a minimum of 300 mm, such that
        uniform consolidation is achieved throughout the deck and slab area.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Where intense compaction is specified both external form vibrators and
    internal vibrators shall be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where rigid formwork is specified on the drawings only steel forms shall be
    used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Internal vibrators shall always be used when external form vibrators are
    used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Screeding of Exposed Surfaces
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Immediately after placing and compaction, exposed surfaces other than decks
    and slabs shall be screeded off to the specified levels and finished with a
    wooden float to an even uniform surface. Construction joints shall be left
    rough in accordance with clause 610.20.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During screeding surplus concrete shall be maintained ahead of the screed
    to ensure full and uniform compaction to exposed concrete surfaces.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete deck and slab surfaces shall be screeded on a longitudinal
    direction using vibrating screeds on screeding guides. The screeding guides
    shall be accurately set and rigidly fixed in position. Guides shall be
    capable of sustaining construction loading without undue or permanent
    deflection.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall submit its proposed method of compaction adjacent
        to screed guides, and its proposed method and timing of repairs at
        screed guide supports for review by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Finishing of Exposed Surfaces
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Final finishing of exposed concrete surfaces shall be carried out after all
    bleed water has been removed and the concrete has become sufficiently hard
    to support the finishing operation. Driers (i.e. dry sand, cement or stone
    dust) shall not be used to absorb free water.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Finishing of concrete decks or slabs shall be effected with a power trowel
    fitted with rotating steel floats.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any drying cracks which appear prior to initial set and before or during
    finishing operations shall be immediately closed as required with either a
    wooden or steel float.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing shall commence immediately following the progressive completion at
    any location of final finishing operations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Protection of Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) from Vibration and
    Disturbance
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the requirements of this clause, SCC shall not be vibrated
    or be subjected to any physical disturbance after deposition. The
    Contractor shall undertake adequate precautions and manage the effects of
    external sources of vibration from nearby activities and construction
    equipment, in accordance with the requirements of clause 610.38, to ensure
    that the freshly placed SCC remains undisturbed and does not segregate.

</p>
<p>
    The placing of concrete shall proceed continuously from joint to joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any point at which the placing of concrete has stopped and the concrete has
    taken its initial set shall be treated as a construction joint.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Construction joints shall be perpendicular to the principal lines of
    stress, and in general shall not be located in regions of maximum bending

<p>
    The curing compounds shall be pigmented sufficiently to allow visual
    inspection to ensure full application on the surface. The pigment shall not
    be visible fourteen days after application. Curing compounds shall not have
    a deleterious effect on the concrete or stain the surface of the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing compound shall be applied by a pressurised sprayer to give a
    uniform cover. The sprayer shall incorporate a device for continuous
    agitation and mixing of the compound in its container during spraying.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing compound shall be applied using a fine spray at the rate stated
    on the certificate of compliance, or at a rate of 0.2 litres/m2 per coat,
    whichever is the greater.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Two coats shall be applied at the full rate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The time between the first and second coat shall be in accordance with the
    manufacturer's recommendation, or on the basis of a trial application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing compounds shall not be applied to construction joints unless the
    joint is to be roughened or sandblasted at a later date.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Curing compounds shall not be applied to surfaces which are to be
    subsequently coated unless they are compatible with the coating,
    waterproofing or surfacing system or provision is made for removal of the
    compound from these surfaces prior to the application of the coating,
    waterproofing or surfacing system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing membranes shall be maintained intact for not less than the
    specified period of curing. Any damage to the curing membranes during the
    period of curing shall be repaired immediately at the original rate of
    application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Determination of Application Rate of Curing Compound
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The application rate shall be checked by calculating the amount of curing
    compound falling on felt mats, each approximately 0.25 m<sup>2</sup> in
    area, placed on the concrete surface during the application of the curing
    compound.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    The application rate shall be determined as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) pre-weighed absorbent felt mats placed at different places on the area
    to be sprayed
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) after the applicator has covered the area concerned, the felt mats are
    immediately folded with their wet sides together, placed in plastic bags to
    prevent evaporative losses and weighed
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (3) the application rate (r) shall be determined as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    r = m/A x &#961;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    where r = application rate, (litres/m<sup>2</sup>)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A = area of felt mat, (m<sup>2</sup>)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    &#961; = density of curing compound (kg/litre), which may be available from
    the material manufacturer's data sheet or the test report
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    m = net mass (weight of felt mat with curing compound minus pre-weighted
    felt mat) (kg)
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Polyethylene Sheet
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Polyethylene sheet shall be of sufficient strength to withstand wind and
    any imposed foot traffic or physical loading. Torn or punctured sheeting
    shall not be used. Laps shall be 300 mm minimum and edges and laps shall be
    sealed by tape or held down by boards or other means. All edges and laps
    shall be sealed against evaporative moisture losses for the duration of
    curing. Water shall be sprayed under the sheeting at the edges and at laps
    on the day after placing concrete and at regular intervals to maintain
    moist conditions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Polyethylene sheet shall not be used on concrete decks or slabs unless used
    in conjunction with water curing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) Curing by Maintaining Formwork in Place
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where formwork is left in place to satisfy the formwork removal times as
    specified in clause 610.25, or where formwork is left in place for the
    specified period of curing or part thereof, the exposed surfaces of the
    concrete shall be cured and the formwork shall be sealed against
    evaporative moisture losses for the duration of curing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where formwork is removed prior to the completion of the curing period,
    curing shall recommence within half an hour and continue until the total
    curing time is not less than the periods of curing specified in Table
    610.231.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (g) Steam Curing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Method of control and the proposed curing cycle to achieve the specified
    concrete compressive strength shall be submitted to the Superintendent.
    After the initial 'maturity' period, units shall be cured in an atmosphere
    saturated with water vapour at a pressure not exceeding atmospheric
    pressure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall take measures to allow for the potential lower 28 day
    compressive strength obtained from test cylinders cured initially under in
    situ conditions, as compared to those cured in accordance with the
    requirements of AS 1012.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Steam Covers
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To prevent drying out, steam covers shall be placed over the units
    immediately following the casting and screeding operations in such a manner
    as to ensure free circulation of the steam around the concrete mass.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Curing Cycle
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After an initial 'maturity' of 40&#176;C hours, but not less than two hours
    after batching the last batch of concrete for the units, steam shall be
    admitted to the steam covers at such a controlled rate that the maximum
    average temperature rise shall not exceed 24&#176;C per hour. (Note: The
    initial 'maturity' period is calculated by dividing 40&#176;C hours by the
    concrete temperature of the last batch of concrete placed in the unit. The
    concrete temperature is as measured on an indicating thermometer.) In
    addition, the temperature rise in any one fifteen minute period shall not
    exceed 6&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the admission of steam to the steam covers is delayed by more than the
    initial specified 'maturity' of 40&#176;C hours after the completion of
    placing of concrete, water curing, as specified in clause 610.23(c) shall
    be applied until steaming commences.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steaming shall continue at a rate such that the temperature rise shall not
    exceed 24&#176;C per hour, until a temperature under the steam covers of
    not greater than 70&#176;C has been reached. The corresponding maximum
    temperature of the concrete shall not exceed 75&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After the elapse of sufficient time at the maximum temperature for the
    required concrete properties to have been reached, steam shall be
    completely shut down. Steam covers shall not be removed nor any part of the
    concrete units and test cylinders disturbed or operated upon in any way
    until the temperature under the steam covers has fallen to within 30&#176;C
    of the ambient temperature. Also the rate of loss of temperature under the
    steam covers after shutting off steam shall not exceed 30&#176;C per hour.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Temperature Controls
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Temperature shall be recorded by means of recording thermometers supplied
    and installed by the Contractor. These thermometers shall be maintained in
    good condition and calibration. The temperature sensitive parts of the
    thermometers shall be so positioned under the steam covers as to cause the
    thermometers to record the minimum temperature under the covers. One
    recording thermometer shall be used for each unit or group of units in line
    up to a total length of 25 m. For greater lengths, additional recording
    thermometers shall be used and the distance between the temperature
    sensitive parts of the thermometers shall not exceed 25 m.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The recording thermometers shall be set in operation immediately upon
    completion of the casting and screeding, the temperature sensitive part of
    each thermometer being installed in position at the same time.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Charts shall not be removed from any recording thermometers, nor the
    recording thermometers disturbed or moved in any way until after the
    removal of the steam covers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Charts from temperature recording thermometers shall be retained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The following information shall be recorded on the chart:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (1) date on which steaming commenced
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (2) unique identification and description of concrete unit
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (3) temperature correction, if any
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (4) time correction, if any
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (5) batching of concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (6) temperature of concrete when placed
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (7) ambient temperature at time of removal of steam covers
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (8) name of Contractor or manufacturer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (v) Steam Delivery
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Under no circumstances shall steam jets be allowed to impinge upon any part
    of the concrete units or of a test specimen, or of their formwork or
    moulds. Neither shall any steam delivery pipe be attached directly to any
    formwork or moulds in such a manner as may cause localised overheating of
    the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sufficient steam jets or steam entry points shall be provided to ensure
    that a substantially uniform temperature is maintained under the steam
    covers such that the difference in temperature between any two points
    adjacent to the concrete units is not more than 10&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (vi) Extent of Steam Curing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, steam curing shall be continuously applied
    until at least the 7 day compressive strength for the specified concrete
    grade is obtained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (vii) Partial Steam Curing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where steam curing is used only to obtain sufficient compressive strength
    for removal of forms or for lifting, curing shall be continued by one or a
    combination of the methods specified in clauses 610.23(c), (d) and (e) for
    a minimum period of seven days from the time of finishing the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where partial steam curing is employed as above, curing shall recommence
    within half an hour of the cessation of steam curing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum requirements of clause 610.23(g)(iii) shall be complied with.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (viii) Curing of Test Cylinders
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete compression test cylinders shall be placed near the concrete
    units, and shall be so positioned under the steam covers as to be midway
    between two adjacent points of steam entry, subject always to their being
    no closer to any points of steam entry than half the width of the concrete
    units. Test cylinders shall be positioned in a group at the lower face of
    the concrete unit and shall in no case be placed on top of the concrete
    unit or its formwork. Test cylinders shall remain in position under the
    steam covers until the steam curing cycle is complete. Test cylinders shall
    be suitably covered in such a way as to minimise moisture and temperature
    losses between the time of removal from the steam covers and the time of
    forwarding to an accredited laboratory for testing. Cylinders shall be
    transported in moisture proof containers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (h) Radiant Heat Curing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The application of heat shall be effected by the circulation of hot water
    which is fed through a series of conduits attached externally to the steel
    form. A heating box used for the curing of concrete test cylinders shall be
    connected to the hot water heating system.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Curing Cycle
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing cycle of the radiant heat curing method shall be in accordance
    with clause 610.23(g)(iii) except that reference to steam curing shall be
    replaced by the application of hot water. The top surface of the finished
    concrete shall be kept moist throughout the curing cycle.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Temperature Controls
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The water temperature shall be controlled by a thermostat and shall not
    exceed 70&#176;C. The corresponding maximum temperature of the concrete
    shall not exceed 75&#176;C. The temperature difference between ingoing and
    outgoing water shall be maintained at less than 10&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Temperature controls shall be in accordance with clause 610.23(g)(iv),
    except that reference to steam covers shall be replaced by curing covers.
    In addition to the specified requirements of clause 610.23(g)(iv), the
    Contractor shall also monitor the temperature of the test cylinder heating
    box by means of a recording thermometer. The difference in temperature
    between the test cylinder heating box and any point along the hot water
    heating system shall not exceed 10&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Curing Covers
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To prevent drying out, curing covers shall be placed over the units after
    the top surface of the concrete has taken its initial set and the watering
    hose has been placed on the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (v) Extent of Radiant Heat Curing
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Radiant heat curing shall be continuously applied until at least the 7 day
    compressive strength for the specified concrete grade is obtained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (vi) Curing of Test Cylinders
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete test cylinders shall be placed in the heating box which is
    connected into the mould heating system as soon as the curing starts and
    shall remain in position until the curing cycle is complete. Test cylinders
    shall be suitably covered to minimise moisture and temperature losses
    between the time of removal from the heating box and the time of forwarding
    to an accredited laboratory for testing. Cylinders shall be transported in
    moisture proof containers.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Delayed Ettringite Formation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    To control the risk of delayed ettringite formation at later ages, the
    maximum concrete temperature during the curing period shall not exceed
    75&#176;C except where analysis has been performed that justifies a
    particular maximum temperature limit for concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (j) Loading of concrete and vibration effects during the curing period
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete shall remain undisturbed and not be subjected to any loading or
    vibration effects for the minimum period of curing as stated in Table
    610.231.
    <p>
    </p>

<p>
    610.24 CRACKING OF CONCRETE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall plan the various construction activities and control
    the supply and delivery of concrete, placing, compacting, finishing, curing
    and protection of freshly cast concrete such that cracking in concrete
    members is prevented.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Maximum Acceptable Crack Widths
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete shall have no cracks at any stage after construction measured
    at the concrete surface of width greater than the relevant value given in
    Table 610.241 for the corresponding exposure classification. Where such
    cracks exist, they shall be identified as a non-conformance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Not withstanding the requirements of this clause the acceptable crack width
    at the concrete surface of pre-cast pre-stressed concrete members shall not
    exceed 0.1 mm.

    The Contractor shall undertake an assessment of the cracked concrete
    structure to evaluate the influence of cracks on the load bearing capacity,
    serviceability and durability.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    The widths of cracks at the concrete surface may be measured using a
    plastic strip gauge with fixed width lines or a hand-held optical
    comparator fitted with a microscope and suitable measuring scale.
    Live/active cracks may be measured with the use of overlapping upper and
    lower plastic plates bonded across the crack or steel studs bonded across
    the crack and movement measured with a Demec gauge or similar device.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The assessment of the cracked concrete structure shall be undertaken
        by a technical specialist with a minimum of 5 years practical
        experience in the diagnostic assessment and investigation of concrete
        structures.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The assessment shall ensure that the cracking of concrete does not
    compromise the durability, strength, serviceability and appearance of the
    concrete structure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall establish the cause(s) of the cracks, crack width, the
    moisture condition of the crack and whether a crack is active or inactive.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP The Contractor shall submit a crack repair procedure for the
        Superintendent's review, prior to any repair works being undertaken.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The repair of concrete cracks shall be in accordance with Section 687.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Repair of Inactive Cracks
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Repair of inactive cracks shall be as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) Cracks up to 1 mm wide shall be repaired by pressure injection of low
    viscosity epoxy resin.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Vertical cracks 1-2 mm wide shall be repaired by pressure injection of
    low viscosity epoxy resin. Horizontal cracks 1-2 mm wide shall be repaired
    either by pressure injection of epoxy resin or other repair methods which
    comply with the requirements of Section 687, provided a supporting
    assessment and evaluation by an appropriately experienced consultant has
    been submitted to the Superintendent for review.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) Cracks over 2 mm shall be repaired with filling materials and methods
    in accordance with the requirements of Section 687. Where the repair of
    such cracks is likely to result in the complete detachment of fractured
    pieces of concrete away from the main concrete member, such fractures shall
    be treated as patch repairs and repaired with polymer modified cementitious
    repair materials in accordance with the requirements of Section 689.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) Where cracks run through the entire cross section and are accessible
    from both sides of a concrete member the larger crack width measurement
    shall be the controlling width for the purposes of crack repair, thus
    requiring the full depth of the crack to be pressure injected with low
    viscosity epoxy resin and if necessary injected from both ends. Such
    concrete members shall include but not be limited to concrete decks slabs,
    all types of walls, slabs, columns, crossheads, diaphragms and abutments.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Repair of Active Cracks
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Live/active cracks shall be repaired using flexible filler materials and
    methods in accordance with the requirements of Section 687.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Water Leakage through to Deck Slab Soffit
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Following inspection, where crack repairs with pressure injected low
    viscosity epoxy resin fail to stop water leakage through the cross section
    to the concrete deck slab soffit, the whole of the top surface of the deck
    slab shall be waterproofed with the installation of a waterproofing
    membrane prior to the placement of asphalt in accordance with the
    requirements of Section 691.

<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork shall be removed carefully and in such a manner as to avoid damage
    to the member or the concrete surfaces and maintain safety at all stages of
    removal.

    Formwork and formwork supports shall not be disturbed or adjusted during
    the concreting operation and shall remain in position and undisturbed until
    the minimum removal times given in Table 610.251 have elapsed, after
    completion of the placing of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Vibration Effects Due to Construction Activities
    <p>
    </p>

</p>
<p>
    The minimum concrete cover to steel reinforcement and other steel
    embedments shall be as shown on the drawings and in accordance with the
    requirements of clause 4.14.3 of AS 5100.5. The dimensional tolerance of
    concrete cover shall be 0 to +5 mm as stated in Table 610.471.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The curing of concrete shall be continuous and uninterrupted in accordance
    with clause 610.23 to ensure the effectiveness of the minimum concrete
    cover.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum concrete cover for concrete members cast in standard formwork
    and compacted with standard compaction as defined in clause 610.03 shall be
    in accordance with the requirements of Table 4.14.3.2 of AS 5100.5.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where lower minimum concrete cover is specified for concrete members cast
    in rigid steel formwork with intense compaction in accordance with Table
    4.14.3.3 of AS 5100.5, the intense compaction shall consist of both
    external form vibrators and internal vibrators as defined in clause 610.03.
    A high level of supervision shall be employed to ensure that the required
    level of intense compaction is achieved and the rigidity of formwork is
    maintained during concrete placement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where curing compounds are used, the concrete cover shall be increased by 5
    mm for classifications A and B1 and by 10 mm for other classifications in

    610.42 COVER AND SPACING REQUIRED FOR CONCRETE PLACEMENT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The minimum cover required for concrete placement and the minimum allowable
    steel reinforcement spacing within a concrete member shall not be less than
    1.5 times the maximum size of aggregate in the concrete mix or the
    reinforcement bar diameter, whichever is the larger, unless greater
    concrete placement requirements apply as per AS 5100.5, to ensure that the
    concrete can be satisfactorily placed, flow and compacted around the steel
    reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    Continuous bar chairs shall provide a minimum gap between the formwork and
    the underside of the bar chair voids of 1.5 times the maximum nominal size
    aggregate in the concrete mix.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The maximum aggregate size shall ensure that effective consolidation and
    aggregate interlock is achieved within a dense concrete microstructure
    without voids and honeycombs which can adversely affect the durability and
    the in situ strength of concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Steel reinforcement shall be placed such that adequate gaps exist for the
    insertion of poker vibrators and concrete can flow around the steel
    reinforcement. Congestion created by a large number of closely placed
    parallel bars with little or no separation shall not be allowed. Where
    bundled bars are used as part of design to overcome steel reinforcement
    congestion, they shall be limited to four in any one bundle with no more
    than two bars in one plane and shall be tied together in contact and be
    enclosed within stirrups or ties. Bundles of bars may consist in groups of
    two, three or four longitudinal bars to act as a unit.

    <strong>
        Drilling of holes in concrete members shall be located as shown on the
        drawings, as specified in this specification or as approved by the
        Superintendent.
    </strong>
    Holes may be drilled with carbide-tipped rotary hammer or diamond-tipped
    core drill.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Holes shall be drilled to the required length and diameter and be
    positioned to avoid damage to steel reinforcement and pre-stressing tendons
    or to services.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to drilling of holes, reinforcing bars, pre-stressing tendons and
    cables and services that lie within the depth of the drill hole shall be
    accurately located by reference to as-constructed drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The actual position of bars and tendons shall then be located by use of a
    recently calibrated concrete cover meter or ground penetrating radar (GPR),
    operated by a competent person. If reinforcement is encountered during
    drilling, drilling shall cease immediately and hole location shall be
    adjusted locally to avoid reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where drilling of holes is undertaken by coring the required depth shall be
    controlled by use of a positive stop device fitted to the coring machine or
    a depth measurement mark placed on the core barrel.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Drilling of holes into concrete members shall be undertaken under the
    direction of a qualified Contractor's representative and for the purposes
    of surveillance, the Contractor shall give the Superintendent a minimum of
    two (2) days written notice of its intention to drill holes into concrete
    members.

    Where existing steel reinforcement is encountered during the drilling
    operation, and holes have been relocated, the uncompleted holes shall be
    cleaned and repaired with a shrinkage compensating polymer modified
    cementitious repair material in accordance with the requirements of Section
    689. The exposed surface of the repaired hole shall be similar in texture
    and colour to the surrounding concrete.
