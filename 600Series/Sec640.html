    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the requirements for the supply and installation of
    steel sheet piles for permanent works.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section also covers specific requirements for sheet pile retaining
    structures.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The supply and installation of sheet piles for temporary works is covered
    by Section 602 and Section 603.

    <strong>
        Sheet piles
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Interlocking steel sections driven to form a continuous line. Sheet piles
    may be used for landscaping, erosion control, containment barriers for
    contaminated materials, noise attenuation walls and retaining structures.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Sheet pile retaining structure
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A cantilever or anchored retaining structure constructed from sheet piles,
    1.5 m or greater in height and steeper than 0.66(H):1(V), or which would
    result in a traffic or pedestrian hazard or damage to neighbouring property
    upon failure.

    640.03 SHEET PILES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sheet piles shall be manufactured in accordance with AS/NZS 3679.1. Steel
    used for the manufacture of sheet piles shall be minimum Grade 350. Sheet
    piles that have previously been used for temporary works shall not be used
    for permanent works.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The dimensions and properties of sheet piles shall comply with the relevant
    requirements of Table 640.031.

    Sheet piles may be cut to length on site as required by saw cutting or
    flame cutting. The ends of all sheet piles shall be square, straight and in
    plane without burrs or imperfections.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Interlock seals shall be applied to the sheet piles before installation
    where specified. Sheet piles shall not be coated for any other purpose
    prior to installation.

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Transport and handling
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Care must be taken to ensure that sheet piles are not damaged during
    transport and handling. Handling holes shall not be cut in sheet piles.
    Sheet piles that are damaged shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the
    Superintendent. Sheet piles that the Superintendent considers cannot be
    repaired shall be replaced.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Marking
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sheet piles shall be clearly marked at 500 mm intervals starting from the
    sheet pile toe.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Driving guide and sheet pile threader
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A driving guide shall be used to ensure that sheet piles achieve the
    specified tolerance of position and verticality. The driving guide shall be
    constructed from steel and shall be fixed in place to prevent movement
    during driving of sheet piles. A sheet pile threader shall be used to
    ensure that sheet piles are interlocked prior to the commencement of sheet
    pile driving.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The details of the driving guide and sheet pile threader shall be
        submitted to the Superintendent for review not less than 14 days prior
        to commencement.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Driving system
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sheet piles shall be driven to the level shown on the drawings without
    causing damage to the sheet piles, and without inducing ground vibrations
    with a peak particle velocity greater than 15 mm/s.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sheet piles may be driven with a vibratory pile driver or with a drop
    hammer. If a drop hammer is used, the drop hammer shall be guided by a
    helmet fixed to the head of the sheet pile, the sheet pile head shall be
    protected by a cushioning material, and the drop height shall not exceed 2
    m to avoid damage to the sheet pile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide details of the driving system including the
    frequency and centrifugal force of vibratory pile drivers and the make,
    model and rated energy of drop hammers and the dimensions and materials of
    the helmet and cushion.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        These details, including calculations which demonstrate that the
        proposed driving system is capable of driving the sheet piles to the
        level shown on the drawings, shall be submitted to the Superintendent
        for review not less than 14 days prior to commencement.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Driving sequence
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All sheet piles shall initially be driven halfway to the level shown on the
    drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP On completion of driving the sheet piles halfway to the level shown
        on the drawings, the Contractor shall obtain the approval of the
        Superintendent to drive the sheet piles to the level shown on the
        drawings.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The sheet piles shall then be driven to the level shown on the drawings.
    Sheet piles drawn down below the level shown on the drawings by the driving
    of adjacent sheet piles shall be extended. Sheet piles that cannot be
    driven to the level shown on the drawings shall be cut off subject to
    approval of the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) Extension of sheet piles
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sheet piles shall be extended in situ by means of full strength butt welds.
    Welding of joints shall be undertaken in accordance with AS/NZS 1554.1.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall provide details of the welding procedure for
        review by the Superintendent not less than 14 days prior.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        HP Welding shall not commence until the welding procedure has been
        qualified as specified in Section 630.

    (g) Acceptance of sheet piles
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The following tolerances shall apply to sheet piles after driving:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) deviation from the plan position shall not exceed 50 mm at the sheet
    pile head
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) deviation from the vertical shall not exceed 5 mm per metre length of
    sheet pile.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a sheet pile is not interlocked, is damaged during driving, exceeds
    the specified tolerances of position and verticality, or is otherwise
    defective, the sheet pile shall be repaired or replaced subject to the
    approval of the Superintendent.

    640.05 COATING OF SHEET PILES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Protective coatings applied to exposed sections of sheet piles after
    installation shall comply with Section 631. Anti&#8209;graffiti coatings
    applied to exposed sections of sheet piles after installation shall comply
    with Section 685.

    640.06 SHEET PILE RETAINING STRUCTURES
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sheet pile retaining structures shall be designed in accordance with AS
    5100.3, and the following requirements:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) the design life shall be 100 years;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) the worst case depth of scour anticipated over the design life shall be
    used to determine the retained height, or alternatively scour protection
    shall be installed and the retained height fixed at the underside of the
    scour protection;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) the minimum thickness required for structural strength shall be
    increased to allow for uniform corrosion and resulting loss of section over
    the design life. The corrosion allowance shall be determined in accordance
    with AS 2159. Alternative corrosion protection systems including higher
    grade steel, protective coatings applied before or after installation and
    cathodic protection systems shall not be used instead of the corrosion
    allowance and shall not be considered when determining the corrosion
    allowance;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) weep holes consisting of 15 mm diameter holes drilled through the
    centre of exposed sections of sheet piles after installation shall be
    provided on a minimum 1 m by 1 m centre grid.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    ##(strikethrough the remainder of this clause if not required):In addition,
    for sheet pile retaining structures with a retained height of 6 m or more
    the design shall be proof-engineered by a Proof Engineer who shall be
    prequalified at Level PE in accordance with the VicRoads prequalification
    scheme.
