    Expansion joint gaps shall be designed and dimensioned for installation at
    a mean temperature of 20&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

    &#176;<strong>C from 20</strong>&#176;
    <strong>
        C (the reference temperature on which the joint width is based at

    surface with a tolerance of 0 to &#8209;2 mm when measured with a 2.5 m
    straight edge at 90&#186; to the joint
    <p>

    Reinforcement for deck joints shall comply with the requirements of Bridge
    Technical Note BTN 004 - Bridge joints.

        HP Prior to casting deck concrete, the Contractor shall ensure that
        there is no conflict between the joint anchors, the deck reinforcement
        and any embedment. Where conflict does occur, the Contractor shall
        submit proposals for resolving the conflict to the Superintendent.

    For joints that are recessed into the end of the bridge deck and the
    adjacent fender-wall, concrete immediately under and around the joint shall
    be placed and compacted in a manner that ensures that there is full contact
    with the underside of the expansion joint and its components and that the
    concrete is free of voids.

    finished profile. Should depressions or high spots be present in the formed
    concrete surface, these shall be filled, cut or ground to the required
    finished profile prior to installation of the joint. Depressions shall be
    filled with a high-strength (minimum 50 MPa) non-shrink mortar that is
    compatible with the expansion joint. The expansion joint shall not be fixed
    in place and holding-down bolts shall not be tensioned until the mortar has
    achieved its nominal strength.

        movement, the affected length shall be removed and re-bedded and all
        bolts replaced with new bolts and re-tensioned. If the concrete under
        the joint is found to have voids or other imperfections or any of the
