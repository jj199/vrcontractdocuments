    686.03 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Adhesion/bond strength:</strong>
    The sum total of the forces of attachment between a dry film and its
    concrete substrate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Anti-carbonation coating:</strong>
    Coating applied to concrete and other cement-based substrates to retard
    their carbonation by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Carbonation:</strong>
    The reaction of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> with alkaline materials such as
    concrete, and cement which lowers the alkalinity (pH) and thus protection
    to steel reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coat:</strong>
    A continuous layer of a coating material resulting from a single
    application.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coating(s):</strong>
    An interchangeable term, meaning either the actual process of covering the
    concrete surface with a layer(s) of paint, or representing a protective or
    decorative coating as defined in this Clause.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Coating system(s):</strong>
    Can be either protective or decorative coating system(s) as defined in this
    clause.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Decorative coating system(s):</strong>
    These can be either film-forming coatings, surface treatments or
    combinations of these which can improve the aesthetic appearance of a
    concrete surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dry film thickness (DFT):</strong>
    The thickness of the applied surface coating(s) after the curing or drying
    time has elapsed.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Film-forming coating(s):</strong>
    Viscous materials which form a pinhole - free film on the concrete surface
    to improve its aesthetic appearance or provide protection by acting as a
    barrier to the ingress of aggressive agents. Coatings are generally applied
    in two or more layers. Thin coatings have a dry film thickness (DFT) of
    100&#8209;300 micron, high build coatings generally exceed 1 mm, whereas
    cementitious coatings are generally thick applications ranging from 1 to 20
    mm thick.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Primer:</strong>
    The first coat of a coating system applied to an uncoated concrete
    substrate designed to enhance adhesion of the coating system onto the
    surface and/or impart a surface binding and toughening effect on the
    substrate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Pore-lining penetrant(s) (Hydrophobic Impregnation(s)):</strong>
    These are low viscosity fluids (i.e. silane, silane/siloxane, siloxane,
    solid silane or silane cream) which react with the available hydroxyl group
    of the silicate structure of the concrete substrate in the presence of
    moisture, thus depositing water-repellent silicone resins chemically bonded
    to the walls of the concrete pore structure. These hydrophobic products can
    penetrate the concrete by several millimetres and work by repelling water
    and waterborne chloride ions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Protective Coating System(s):</strong>
    Either film-forming coatings, surface treatments or combinations of these
    which can impart protective qualities to the concrete surface against the
    ingress of aggressive agents.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sealer(s):</strong>
    These are viscous fluids which are intermediate between pore-lining
    penetrants and film-forming coatings. They can penetrate and block the
    pores of the concrete substrate and also form a thin film on its surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Surface Treatment(s):</strong>
    Viscous materials such as pore-lining penetrants (hydrophobic
    impregnations) and sealers which can penetrate the concrete or block the
    pores of the concrete to improve its aesthetic or protective qualities.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Undercoat:</strong>
    Highly pigmented coating which can serve as a first coat or intermediate
    coat before the finish coating to provide hiding power and improved
    adhesion of a top coat to the substrate.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Wet film thickness (WFT):</strong>
    The thickness of the wet coating immediately after application.

<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Performance Requirements for Decorative/Anti-Carbonation Coatings
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required, concrete surfaces shall be painted with at least two coats
    of an approved decorative/anti-carbonation coating system (VicRoads Grey or
    approved alternative colour) in accordance with AS/NZS 2311 and the
    manufacturer's specification to achieve a uniform colour and texture. The
    primer which forms an integral part of the coating system shall be applied
    onto the concrete substrate prior to the application of subsequent coats of
    the approved decorative/anti&#8209;carbonation coating. If a uniform colour
    and texture is not achieved the Contractor shall take remedial measures at
    his own expense to produce the required surface finish.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the general requirements of Clause 686.05(a), approved
    coatings shall also satisfy the minimum performance criteria shown in Table
    686.051, as determined by testing in accordance with the requirements of
    AS/NZS 4548.5 and AS 1580.108.2.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface preparation shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's
    recommendations for the coating system to be applied and as specified in
    this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Uncoated Concrete
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete surfaces shall be dry unless otherwise approved by the
    Superintendent, and shall be free from oil (e.g. from release oils),
    grease, laitance and loose particles, remnants of curing compounds and
    organic contaminants (i.e. moss, algae etc). The concrete surface shall be
    prepared by high pressure jetting with potable water, either with or
    without added abrasive (i.e. up to 3000 psi or 20.7 MPa), steam cleaning,
    wire brushing, abrasion with angle grinder, or by other means to provide a
    strong, hard surface. Areas of persistent contamination shall be removed
    from the surface by the use of appropriate solvents or detergents followed
    by washing with potable water in accordance with AS 1627.1. Any abrasive
    blast cleaning shall be carried out in accordance with AS 1627.4 and other
    OH&amp;S and Environmental regulations imposed by the local government
    authority and the EPA.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any blow holes, areas of honeycombing, loose surface layers and weak
    concrete, shrinkage cracks of width less than 0.2 mm or other defects,
    either revealed by a grinding process or exposed by other surface
    preparation methods, shall be filled with a suitable fairing coat
    cementitious repair material in accordance with the requirements of Section
    689. If the surface of the concrete is weak, more material shall be removed
    and repaired in accordance with the requirements of Section 689. Such
    repairs shall be sufficient to result in a strong, sound substrate suitable
    for the intended protective or decorative coating system. Projecting fins,
    rough spots and sudden steps shall be removed by light abrasion with an
    angle grinder to provide a surface which can be easily coated.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Inactive cracks of width equal to or greater than 0.20 mm shall be sealed
    by resin injection in accordance with Section 687. Active cracks equal to
    or greater than 0.20 mm shall be treated by methods approved by the
    Superintendent and in accordance with Section 687.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A trial application to check the suitability of the surface, the surface
    preparation methods and other requirements shall be undertaken as set out
    in Clause 686.13.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) Previously Painted Surfaces
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Previously painted surfaces shall be clean and sound. All traces of dust,
    dirt and other contaminants (i.e. oils, grease, etc.), peeling or loose
    coating shall be removed by suitable methods as stated in Clause 686.06(b)
    approved by the Superintendent. The compatibility and adhesion of the
    existing coating to the concrete surface shall be evaluated by the
    cross&#8209;cut adhesion test in accordance with AS 1580.408.4 and as
    stated in Clause 686.14.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A trial application and adhesion testing shall be undertaken to establish
    the effectiveness of the bond between the existing and new coating in
    accordance with AS 1580.408.5 and Clauses 686.13 and 686.14.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the compatibility and adhesion tests prove unsatisfactory the existing
    coatings shall be removed and the concrete surface prepared appropriately
    to receive the new coating in accordance with Clause 686.06(b).

    686.07 METHOD OF APPLICATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Dry Concrete Surfaces
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All concrete surfaces to receive a coating shall be dry at the time of
    application. Sufficient drying time shall be allowed after wet preparation
    methods to satisfy the requirements of Clause 686.14.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The coating shall be applied following the manufacturer's recommended
    application methods, overcoating times and coverage rates, mixing
    requirements, current materials safety data sheets and as specified in this
    section. The coating may be applied by brush, spray, roller, hand/glove or
    other technique to achieve the desired surface finish. Coverage rates shall
    be checked for compliance with the manufacturer's requirements. The surface
    area of the concrete structure subject to application and the volume of
    coating used shall be recorded by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The coating system shall be applied as soon as possible (i.e. within 24
    hours unless otherwise expressed in writing by the manufacturer) after the
    preparation of the concrete surface. The prepared surface shall be
    protected against contamination if it is left uncoated for more than 24
    hours.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For multiple coat applications, the manufacturer's stated minimum and
    maximum overcoating times for the prevailing weather conditions shall be
    satisfied, and successive coats shall have slightly different colour shades
    to assist in achieving uniform coverage. The difference in colour shall be
    such that a coat when either wet or dry shall be clearly distinguishable by
    means of colour difference, from the preceding coat.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No application of coatings shall be made if any of the conditions stated in
    Clause 686.11 exist.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No coating shall be applied over any coat which contains application
    defects or any damage until such defects have been repaired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the coating is too thin, or shows evidence of having been applied under
    unfavourable conditions, or the workmanship is poor, or the specified
    requirements are not fulfilled, the surface shall be re&#8209;treated to
    the extent required by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the methods of application are unacceptable to the Superintendent
    because of undesirable effects such as over spray, spatter or significant
    disruption to the public, alternative methods shall be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If, in the opinion of the Superintendent, conditions become unsatisfactory,
    work shall not be continued, and newly coated surfaces shall be protected
    with shelters from rain or other damage as approved by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Further to the other requirements of this clause pore-lining penetrants
    (i.e. silane, silane/siloxane, siloxane, solid silane or silane cream)
    shall be applied by an airless pump system with an operating pressure not
    exceeding 70 kPa in order to ensure that no atomization or misting of the
    material occurs. Application shall be carried out in a series of continuous
    operations. The material shall be applied by a continuous spray technique
    giving saturation flooding, working from the lowest level and proceeding
    upward toward higher elevations. The treated area shall have a 'wet look'
    for a few seconds after application. Areas to be treated with a pore-lining
    penetrant shall, where necessary, be protected from adverse weather
    conditions and shall be surface dry for a minimum of 24 hours before
    application commences.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Bearings, painted steel surfaces, plastic and joint sealants adjacent to
    members to be impregnated with a pore-lining penetrant shall be masked-off
    before impregnation.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A trial application to check the suitability of the method of coating
    application shall be undertaken as set out in Clause 686.13.

</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) Specific Requirements
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All multi-part coating materials shall be mixed according to the coating
    material manufacturer's instructions. The components shall be mixed in the
    specified proportions. The specified reaction period shall be allowed from
    the time the components are mixed until the application begins. No coating
    material shall be excessively thinned and any thinners used shall be the
    correct type as specified by the material manufacturer. The coating
    material shall be strained as specified by the material manufacturer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No coating material shall be applied after its pot life has expired.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where quantities of coating material are being applied by spraying
    successive batches of premixed multi&#8209;part material, the equipment
    shall be flushed and purged with clean solvent after 2/3 of the pot life of
    the material has expired from either the mixing of the first batch or since
    the last purge and cleaning of the equipment. Coating material ingredients
    shall be kept properly mixed in the spray pots or container during the
    application of the material whether by continuous mechanical agitation or
    intermittent manual agitation as required.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where brush or roller techniques are used, the brushes or roller heads
    shall be used for the day only and then discarded. The equipment shall not
    be cleaned for re&#8209;use.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All coating operations shall be performed in a neat and workmanlike manner
    by personnel with experience in the use of protective coatings and
    application methods.

</p>
<p>
    Each coat shall be smooth, uniform and free from sags, runs, mud cracking,
    wrinkling, fat edges, blisters, pinholes, holidays, dry spray, entrapped
    foreign bodies and heavy brush marks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Damp Concrete Surfaces
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Coatings for application on damp concrete substrates shall be specifically
    formulated for tolerance to moisture during application, curing and
    subsequent service.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All concrete surfaces to receive coating shall be surface-dry at the time
    of application. Where this requirement is not satisfied, temporary
    protection shall be provided to encase the concrete and coating applicator
    and prevent moisture penetration, ensuring adequate ventilation is
    provided. Deposits of salt crystals which collect on coated surfaces shall
    be washed off with potable water and the surface allowed to dry, prior to
    further coating application.
