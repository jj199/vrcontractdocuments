    This section specifies the requirements for the supply of materials,
    testing and construction of soil nail walls.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Soil nailing and/or a soil nail wall shall not be used as soil
        reinforcements or as a soil retaining structure to support any existing
        bridge spill-through abutment where the existing spill-through abutment
        fill is to be removed to make way for an increase of clearance either
        vertically or horizontally beneath the bridge superstructure.
        Dispensation for this requirement may be granted if all the following
        conditions are satisfied:
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (a) the abutment is supported on bored piles with a minimum pile diameter
    greater than 900 mm
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) the bored piles have adequate structural and geotechnical strength to
    support any lateral pressure induced by soil movements due to the
    construction of a soil nail wall
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) the superstructure, its bearings and its expansion joints can
    accommodate the additional lateral displacement of the piles without any
    detrimental effect to the serviceability of the structure during its design
    life
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) a monitoring program for ground movement and structure displacement is
    submitted to the Superintendent for review 4 weeks before the construction
    of any soil nail walls.

    For the purpose of this section the following definitions shall apply:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Soil N</strong>
    <strong>ail</strong>
    A component of a soil strengthening system consisting of steel or fibre
    reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement bar(s) inserted centrally into a
    pre&#8209;drilled hole and grouted in place. A soil nail does not require
    post-tensioning.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Soil</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    <strong>Nail Wall</strong>
    A soil strengthening system consisting of soil nails installed at
    appropriate intervals in both horizontal and vertical directions to provide
    permanent support to the material retained by the wall.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Bonded Length</strong>
    The length of a soil nail along which passive resistance is developed.

</p>
<p>
    (i) verify by exhumation of sacrificial nails that the soil nail
    installation procedure will achieve a minimum cover of 40 mm of dense

    test nails
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) demonstrate that the nails will be installed with the lowest part of
    the nail a minimum of one metre above the maximum known groundwater table.

<p>
    Unless the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
    Superintendent that all of the drilled holes for the soil nails will not
    collapse in any form or shape at any stage during the entire soil nail
    installation process, temporary casings shall be placed for the full depth
    of the bored holes to support and prevent collapse of the drilled holes
    until supported by the soil nail system itself. The casing shall be

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water shall be added to the mixer first, then the cement shall be added
    gradually, and the grout stirred continuously until pumped into the soil
    nail hole. Grout shall be stirred for a minimum period of two minutes prior
    to being pumped into the soil nail hole. Admixtures shall be added to the

    the pumps shall be fitted with 2.36 mm sieve strainers. Grout shall not be
    used later than 1.5 hours after the addition of cement to the mix.
    <p>
    </p>

    Pumps shall be capable of continuous operation with little pressure
    variation, and shall have a system for recirculating the grout whilst
    actual grouting is not in progress. Pumps shall be fitted with a pressure
    gauge and shall be capable of delivery at pressures up to 1 MPa. The use of
    compressed air will not be permitted.
    <p>

    5&#176;C, or while the shade temperature exceeds 35&#176;C.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Just prior to grouting, the Contractor shall ensure that all loose soil in
    a soil nail hole is removed. The soil nail bar shall then be placed
    centrally in the drill hole. Where a soil nail hole is supported by a
    temporary casing, the casing shall be withdrawn gradually. A minimum of 0.5
    m of the bottom end of the casing shall be filled with grout before the
    casing is fully withdrawn.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Grout shall then be injected into each sheathing at a speed of between 0.3
    m and 0.6 m per second.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor's grouting procedure shall ensure that there are no air or
    water inclusions left in the grouted zone.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The volume of grout for each hole shall be recorded. The Contractor shall
    cease the grouting operation if the volume of grout injected is greater
    than ten times of the calculated volume to complete the grouting of the
    soil nail. The Contractor shall report this to the Superintendent
    immediately and no further grouting shall be continued until the condition
    is reviewed by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where seepage of grout in a soil nail hole has occurred subsequent to
    grouting, the Contractor shall top up the soil nail hole with grout to the
    satisfaction of the Superintendent.

    The Contractor shall assess the load required to exhume the soil nail in
    order that the soil nail reinforcement as defined in 683.06 will not fail
    prematurely under the test load and that the entire length of the soil nail
    can be exhumed from its drill hole.

    exhumed to verify the adequacy of the grout cover. Precautions shall be
    taken to avoid damage during exhumation to the grout column. The exhumed
    nails shall be cut into 500 mm lengths and the minimum grout cover at each
    section shall be photographed, measured and recorded.

    If any section on any nail in the batch has a grout cover less than the
    specified minimum cover the Contractor shall amend the installation
    procedure and conduct further exhumation tests until the specified minimum
    cover is achieved at each section of each batch of 3 sacrificial test
    nails.

    If the Contractor proposes to install production nails without
    encapsulation the soil nail installation procedure shall be validated in
    each type of soil profile encountered by installing and exhuming each batch
    of three fully grouted production nails. The exhumed nails shall not be
    reused as production nails.

    Notwithstanding of requirements of Type III Production Nail Testing, if any
    test result fails to meet the acceptance criteria, the Contractor shall
    undertake the following actions to the satisfaction of the Superintendent.
    In addition, the Superintendent may nominate additional testing at no
    additional cost to the Superintendent:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) review the soil nail designs and installation procedures
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) undertake further testing to verify revised soil nail designs and
    installation procedures
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) submit the revised soil nail designs and testing results to the
    Superintendent for review.

<p>
    Geocomposite strip drains shall be securely fixed to the excavated soil
    face prior to construction of the sprayed concrete wall and shall be masked
    to prevent concrete adhering to the filter face.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The low point of each strip drain shall be connected to a collector pipe
    with outlets to a spoon drain in front of the wall or as specified on the
    drawings. The collector pipe shall be fitted with a flush-out riser
    connected to an inspection opening at the top of the wall as shown on the
    drawing.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Preformed PVC fittings shall be used for all connections between strip
    drains and the collector pipe and all connections shall be sealed and
    protected to prevent ingress of concrete during concrete spraying.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The collector pipe shall be flushed within 4 hours of the completion of the
    sprayed concrete surrounding it.
