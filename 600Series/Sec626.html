    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) Divert or dispose of water where necessary to enable construction of
    the culvert. The diversion shall be in the form of temporary channels or
    temporary pipes.
    <strong>
        Pumping options shall not be used.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
