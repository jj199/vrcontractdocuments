    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section specifies the requirements for the cathodic protection (CP) of
    steel in reinforced concrete structures which are atmospherically exposed,
    buried or submerged. The section applies to both new and existing
    structures, including relevant inspection and testing, acceptance criteria
    for both normal reinforcement and prestressed reinforcement embedded in
    concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Cathodic protection of prestressed reinforcement embedded in concrete
        shall be subject to approval by the Superintendent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Note: Due to the possible occurrence of hydrogen embrittlement, high
    strength steels should not be exposed to a potential more negative than
    &#8209;900 mV (Ag/AgCl/0.5M KCl). Prestressing steel may be sensitive to
    hydrogen embrittlement which can cause catastrophic failure due to high
    tensile loading of prestressing members. It is essential that caution be
    exercised in any application of CP to prestressed elements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    CP of steel in reinforced concrete structures shall be undertaken in
    accordance with the requirements of AS 2832.5, unless otherwise stated.
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    681.02 PROTECTION CRITERIA
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The CP system shall deliver sufficient current to satisfactorily polarise
    the reinforcement of the whole of the reinforced concrete structure in all
    cathodic protection zones.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Satisfactory polarisation shall be demonstrated by achieving the protection
    criteria in accordance with the requirements of AS 2832.5.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Satisfactory polarisation of the steel reinforcement in accordance with
    these protection criteria shall be achieved within 26 weeks of the date of
    first energising the CP system for all zones.

    681.05 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cathodic Protection (CP):</strong>
    Cathodic protection of reinforcing steel in concrete is an electrochemical
    method used to mitigate active corrosion of steel reinforcement, or prevent
    future reinforcement corrosion by passing a small direct current between an
    external or embedded anode material and the steel reinforcement. Sufficient
    cathodic current will ensure the reinforcing steel is entirely cathodic and
    suppress any existing or future anodes on the steel within the concrete
    electrolyte.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Electrolyte:</strong>
    The liquid component in a composite material such as soil or concrete, in
    which electric current may flow by ionic charge transfer.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Anode:</strong>
    A metal which is placed in or in contact with an electrolyte and connected
    to the steel reinforcement to apply CP to a reinforced concrete structure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP):</strong>
    Cathodic protection effected by applying direct current supplied by an
    external power source to cathodically protect the steel reinforcement in a
    concrete structure. The ICCP system necessitates the presence of normal AC
    power and a transformer/rectifier to convert it to a DC power source. The
    external DC power unit is used to create an electric circuit between the
    steel reinforcement and supplemental anodes which are fixed onto the
    external concrete surface, embedded into the concrete or buried or
    submerged (the latter in the case of protection to the buried or submerged
    zones). The steel reinforcement is connected to the negative DC output and
    the anodes are connected to the positive DC output.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sacrificial anode cathodic protection:</strong>
    Cathodic protection effected by connecting a low driving voltage
    sacrificial anode (i.e. reactive metals such as zinc, aluminium or
    magnesium or alloys of these metals) onto the steel to develop a potential
    difference between the two metals which is sufficient to counteract any
    corrosion cells existing on the steel. The anode material discharges
    current to the steel through the concrete electrolyte and corrodes
    preferentially.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Reference electrode:</strong>
    A monitoring sensor (i.e. Ag/AgCl, Mn/MnO<sub>2</sub>, Cu/CuSO<sub>4</sub>)
    which is permanently fixed (embedded) within an electrolyte, such as
    concrete, and close to the steel reinforcement, used to measure the
    electrical potential of that portion of the steel reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transformer/rectifier (T/R):</strong>
    An electrical power unit which transforms and rectifies AC line voltages to
    the required lower DC output voltages, also referred to as a 'DC power
    supply'.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Zone:</strong>
    A discrete part of a reinforced concrete structure and/or CP system
    characterised by different environmental exposure conditions (i.e.
    submerged, tidal, splash, atmospheric zones) within its overall
    in&#8209;service environment.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Energising:</strong>
    The process of the initial application of power to an impressed current
    cathodic protection system.
