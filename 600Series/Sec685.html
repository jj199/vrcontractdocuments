    </p>
</p>
<p>
    685.05 SURFACE PREPARATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The surface preparation shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's
    recommendations for the coating system to be applied and as specified in
    this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        All dust, dirt and other surface contaminants shall be removed by
        appropriate means as approved by the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    The surface shall then be washed with water such that grease and oil
    contaminants, including remnants of curing membranes, shall be removed from
    the surface by the use of appropriate solvents or detergents followed by
    the water washing in accordance with AS 1627.1.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where an anti&#8209;graffiti coating system is specified, the substrate
    shall be free of all graffiti, graffiti shadows, paints, or any other
    surface contaminants which would be visible through the coating.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where shadows of previously removed graffiti are likely to be clearly
    visible through a coating, a suitable anti&#8209;bleed stain sealer shall
    be applied prior to the application of any subsequent coatings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where required to promote adhesion of the coating system, some concrete and
    other substrate surfaces may be cleaned by whip blasting with a fine grade
    garnet or surface etched with an approved acid wash followed by a water
    wash in accordance with AS 1627.1. Any abrasive blast cleaning shall be
    carried out in accordance with AS 1627.4 and appropriate regulations
    imposed by the local government authority and the EPA.

    685.06 ANTI&#8209;GRAFFITI COATING SYSTEMS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) General
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The anti&#8209;graffiti coating system shall be non&#8209;sacrificial,
        clear or pigmented coating to a specified colour.
    </strong>
    The coating system shall be an acrylic&#8209;copolymer,
    acrylic&#8209;epoxy, polyurethane or polyurea type. All coats in the system
    shall be of the same brand and must be compatible with each other.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The use of sacrificial anti&#8209;graffiti coatings is subject to the
        approval of the Superintendent.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Substrate surfaces other than concrete may require variations of the usual
    treatment applied to concrete surfaces. Highly porous substrates may
    require a pore&#8209;filling primer coat prior to applying a final
    anti&#8209;graffiti finish. For relatively soft surfaces the primer and/or
    finish coat shall also offer surface binding and toughening effect.
    Manufacturer's recommendations shall be sought in all such cases.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) Performance Requirements
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The coating system shall be non&#8209;yellowing and UV resistant for its
    guaranteed exposure life and shall exhibit low dirt retention capability.
    The coating shall be impermeable to chlorides, water, carbon dioxide and
    acid rain but allow the transmission of water vapour.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The coating system shall carry a guaranteed outdoor exposure life of not
    less than 10 years and a guaranteed 'Graffiti Removal' life of at least 8
    cycles of defacement and removal from the date of application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sacrificial anti&#8209;graffiti coatings if approved by the Superintendent
    shall carry a guaranteed outdoor exposure life of not less than 5 years
    from the date of application.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall provide evidence as to the compatibility of the
    proposed coating system to the nominated substrate. Such evidence shall
    include but not be limited to test certificates endorsed in accordance with
    the AS ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for the testing laboratory and history
    of previous performance.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where a primer or undercoat is required as part of the anti&#8209;graffiti
    coating system, it shall be a different colour to that of the final
    nominated colour and in accordance with AS 2700.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The coating pigments shall be colourfast, and not subject to fading or
    discolouration.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The finished coating system shall have a minimum wet film thickness (WFT)
    of 175 mm and a minimum anti&#8209;graffiti coating dry film thickness
    (DFT) of 100 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where an anti&#8209;graffiti coating is also used as an
    anti&#8209;carbonation coating its minimum DFT shall be 150 mm and shall
    comply with the requirements of Section 686 for anti-carbonation coating.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The applied coating system shall have an adhesion value of greater than
    0.75 MPa to the substrate in accordance with AS 1580.408.5.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For penetrating anti&#8209;graffiti coating systems applied to full
    saturation, the minimum amount of penetration into the substrate and
    minimum application rate shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's
    recommendations.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    685.07 METHOD OF APPLICATION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The application of coating systems and removal of graffiti shall be carried
    out in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, current
    materials safety data sheets and as specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The substrate shall not be coated until it is surface dry. Sufficient time
    shall elapse between coatings to allow the initial coat to dry and cure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The finished coating shall be smooth, of uniform thickness, colour and
    appearance and without runs, beads, surface crazing and shall be free of
    any defects that may impair the performance or appearance of the coating
    for the life of the coating.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the coating is too thin, or shows evidence of having been applied under
    unfavourable conditions, or the workmanship is poor, or the specified
    requirements are not fulfilled, the surface shall be re&#8209;treated to
    the extent required by the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where the methods of application or removal are unacceptable to the
    Superintendent because of undesirable effects such as over spray, spatter
    or significant disruption to the public, alternative methods shall be used.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If, in the opinion of the Superintendent, conditions become unsatisfactory,
    work shall not be continued, and newly coated surfaces shall be protected
    with approved shelters from rain or other damage.

</p>
<p>
    Graffiti removal from existing coatings or untreated substrates shall be
    strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation and as
    specified in this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Typical graffiti removal methods shall include but not be limited to:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    1. chemical cleaning
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    2. steam cleaning
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    3. hot or cold high pressure water cleaning with or without detergents

</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the compatibility of the
    proposed cleaning method without injurious effect to any applied coatings,
    paint systems and uncoated substrates.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Damage to the substrate, substrate coating or anti&#8209;graffiti coatings
    caused by the Contractor shall be rectified.

<p>
    For anti&#8209;graffiti coated substrates the standard of graffiti removal
    shall be based on no residual graffiti markings being visible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For uncoated substrates the complete removal may not be possible due to the
    absorbency of the substrate material. Under these circumstances, the
    Superintendent may allow some residual paint staining or shadowing to
    remain.

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
    Prior to overcoating, a suitable anti&#8209;bleed stain sealer shall be
    applied to prevent any subsequent bleed through of residual graffiti stain
    in the finish coat. If a uniform colour and texture is not achieved the
    Contractor shall take remedial measures to produce the required surface
    finish. For painting out of graffiti the accepted standard of graffiti
    removal shall be no residual graffiti being visible.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Approved coatings shall be applied at a minimum DFT of 150 mm and shall
    comply with the requirements of Section 686 for anti&#8209;carbonation
    coating.
