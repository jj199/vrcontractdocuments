        Superintendent.
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall ensure that adjacent structures and services are not
    damaged during construction of the piles.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The pile shall be augered in one continuous operation to the depth shown on
    the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete delivery hose shall be primed and pressurised and the toe of
    the auger shall then be withdrawn progressively.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The boring rate, penetration rate and torque shall be monitored and
    recorded throughout the augering process.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall produce a field log of the materials encountered over
    the full depth of the excavation. The materials retrieved at 1 metre depth
    intervals during the course of the drilling shall be recorded and inspected
    by the Contractor's geotechnical consultant who shall confirm that they are
    consistent with the design assumptions and in accordance with the
    Contractor's installation procedure prior to casting. If it is necessary to
    increase the depth of the pile to achieve the required pile capacity, the
    Contractor shall:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (a) determine the required increase in depth of the pile in accordance with
    the Contractor's procedure for review and confirmation that the pile has
    achieved the required design capacity;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (b) determine the required increase in depth of the pile in accordance with
    the Contractor's procedure for reviewing the design of the pile if ground
    conditions at the anticipated depth vary from the anticipated conditions;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (c) obtain confirmation from the Contractor's geotechnical consultant of
    the required increase in depth of the pile;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) provide a full account of the need for the increase to the
    Superintendent for review.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where piles are founded on rock, they shall extend the specified minimum
    distance into rock of the type and quality shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Contractor shall provide a work method statement and procedure for
        construction of the CFA pile if there is a risk of an uncontrolled
        leakage of concrete into a watercourse or other sensitive area due to
        presence of weak stratum. As a minimum, the Contractor shall provide a
        temporary steel casing down to a level below which there is no risk of
        such leakage. The Contractor shall consult its geotechnical consultant
        whom shall verify the appropriateness of the construction procedure.
        The Contractor shall provide the geotechnical consultant's report to
        the Superintendent for review.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Pile shafts shall be formed by injecting concrete continually as the auger
    is extracted. The method of maintaining positive pressure in the pumping
    equipment, and the method of maintaining an oversupply rate for concrete,
    shall be in accordance with the Contractor's installation procedure.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The auger extraction rate, concrete pressure and concrete oversupply shall
    be monitored and recorded throughout the augering process.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The concrete pressure and rate of concrete delivery shall be maintained as
    the auger is withdrawn in order to ensure that the pile excavation is
    completely filled and is free of voids and inclusions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The reinforcement cage shall be placed and centralised in the pile as soon
    as is practicable after the pile has been concreted and while the concrete
    is still plastic. The reinforcement shall then be allowed to descend under
    its own weight until the correct level is reached.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<strong>
    <br clear="all"/>
</strong>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    If the reinforcement cage cannot be installed to the required level under
    the effects of gravity, a small vibratory drive head may be used to
    complete the installation of the cage subject to approval by the
    Superintendent, and provided the Contractor is able to demonstrate that
    such vibration will not cause segregation or bleeding in the concrete nor
    adversely affect the integrity of the steel cage.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Further to the requirements of Clause 611.10 spacers and supports for CFA
    pile steel reinforcement shall be placed at intervals of no more than 2 m
    along the full length of the steel reinforcement cage to ensure that the
    specified concrete cover to the steel reinforcement is maintained.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Care shall be taken to prevent soil or rock dislodging from the side of the
    excavation or from the ground around the top of the excavation that may
    contaminate the concrete and that may reduce the effective diameter of the
    pile or the minimum cover to reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles shall be constructed to ground level or a minimum of 300 mm above
    pile cut-off level to allow breaking back of concrete at the top of the
    pile.

    damaged during the installation of subsequent piles or by other
    construction activities and plant movements.
