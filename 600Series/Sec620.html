    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    This section covers the manufacture, storage, handling and delivery of
    precast concrete units.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Concrete for these units shall be in accordance with Section 610
    'Structural Concrete' and reinforcement shall be in accordance with Section
    611 'Steel Reinforcement'.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>

    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    620.02 FORMS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Forms shall be manufactured from steel, except where otherwise approved by
    the Superintendent.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The formwork shall be constructed so as to produce the finished concrete to
    the shape, lines and dimensions shown on the drawings, and in accordance
    with the surface finish and tolerances specified in Section 610 'Structural
    Concrete'.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Void formers shall be securely restrained in position vertically against
    the action of placing concrete and subsequent flotation under vibration.
    The void former shall likewise be laterally restrained against forces
    arising from differential pressures during placing of concrete. Void
    formers shall comply with the requirements of Section 614.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The use of wires or bolts extended to the surface of the concrete will not
    be permitted except where shown on the drawings. Any embedded ties shall
    remain embedded and shall terminate not less than the specified concrete
    cover. All recesses shall be filled in accordance with the surface finish
    provisions of Section 610.
    <p>
    </p>

    620.03 REMOVAL OF UNITS FROM FORMS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Individual precast units with mass of five tonnes or less shall have a
    minimum concrete compressive strength of 10 MPa for removal of units from
    forms. For individual precast units of mass greater that five tonnes, the
    minimum concrete compressive strength shall be 20 MPa for removal of units
    from forms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Lifting of precast units at a minimum concrete compressive strength other
    than that specified in this clause shall be supported with structural
    calculations and maturity testing for estimating the in situ strength of
    concrete in accordance with the requirements of Clause 610.16(l). The
    structural calculations shall be certified by an Engineer who has
    qualifications admitting to Corporate Membership of the Institution of
    Engineers, Australia, with a minimum of five years experience in structural
    design.
    <p>

<p>
    620.04 PROJECTING REINFORCEMENT
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Where shown on the drawings, steel reinforcement shall be left projecting
    for the purpose of bonding on subsequent work. Care shall be taken to avoid
    disturbing the bars during the specified period for curing of the concrete.
    Projecting reinforcement which has been damaged or dislodged or which is
    loose in the concrete will be cause for rejecting of the units.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Continuity bars shall be positioned within 3 mm of the positions shown on
    the drawings. The relative deviation of any two bars cross sections, taken
    at right angles to the longitudinal centreline of the unit over the
    projecting length of bar, shall be within 3 mm.

    620.05 SOLE PLATES AND BEARING RETAINERS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Material for sole plates and bearing retainers shall be of structural grade
    steel complying with the requirements of AS 3678. All surfaces and edges of
    sole plates shall be finished smooth and bearing surfaces shall have a
    maximum out of flatness of 0.4 mm unless otherwise specified on the
    drawings. Prior to galvanizing, the surface finish on edges shall be
    equivalent to a Class 1 flame cut surface as specified by the Australian
    Welding Research Association. Welding shall comply with the requirements of
    AS/NZS 1554, Part 1.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, steel sole plates shall be galvanized in
    accordance with the requirements of AS/NZS 4680. The minimum mass of zinc
    coating shall be 0.6 kg/m2 of surface.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Sole plates shall be set to the required grades shown on the drawings, or
    as specified by the Superintendent. They shall be arranged so that the
    bearing surfaces are at right angles to the vertical axis of the unit.

    620.06 MARKING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The identification number, date of casting, the manufacturer's name or
    registered mark and the maximum mass shall be marked on every precast unit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Temporary identification shall be made on the top surface of the unit near
    an end, except for parapet units. Final marking shall be made by indelible
    marking material, using letters approximately 40 mm high.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    For parapet units, temporary identification shall be made on the broomed
    surface of the parapet as shown on the drawings. Final markings shall be
    made on one end of each unit.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Piles shall be marked and numbered at 500 mm increments starting from the
    toe with an indelible marking material.

    620.07 HANDLING AND STORAGE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Units shall not be stored in areas subject to flooding.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Units shall not be stored within 10 m of existing or proposed overhead
    power or telephone lines, or over service conduits, drainage pipes or
    uncompacted fill.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The units shall be supported on bearers clear of the ground. Bearers shall
    support the units over their full width and be placed perpendicular to the
    longitudinal axis of the unit. Unless specified otherwise, bearers shall be
    placed beneath the specified or approved lifting points clear of any sole
    plates. The ground or space between the bearers supporting the units shall
    be carefully cleared and levelled so as to prevent the unit from being
    supported other than on the bearers. The bearers shall rest on a firm
    foundation, and adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent subsidence
    from occurring and to prevent the units bearing other than at the specified
    support positions.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any units damaged or distorted in excess of the specified tolerances prior
    or during installation shall be replaced at the Contractor's expense.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Where the method of handling and supporting is not specified, the
        Contractor shall submit, for review by the Superintendent, details of
        his proposals 14 days prior to lifting and supporting the units.
    </strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise specified, precast units shall be lifted using the lifting
    points provided and supported with the top surface uppermost at all times.
    The angle subtended by the slings and the longitudinal axis of the unit
    shall be not less than 60&#176;.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Beams shall be stored and handled with webs vertical at all times.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All beams shall be laterally supported. The lateral bracing shall be
    designed for 10% of the dead load of the beam at the mid height of the
    beam.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Beams and parapet units shall not be stored in stacks.
    <p>
    </p>

</strong>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Slabs, planks and piles may be stored in separate stacks of identical units
    up to a maximum height of 2 m, or two units high, whichever is greater.
    Crown units may be stored in separate stacks of identical units up to a
    maximum height of 3 m. The upper layers shall be separated from the lower
    layers by suitable timber bearers in line vertically at the specified
    supporting points. Timber supports for upper layers shall be placed
    directly above the supports of the layer below.

<p>
    620.08 TRANSPORTING
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Units shall not be transported from the precast yard until specified 28 day
    concrete compressive strength has been achieved, and not before 7 days
    after casting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Units shall be securely fixed to the transporter and provision shall be
    made to protect the units from damage caused by lashings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    During transport of beam units the Contractor shall provide end bracing
    and, if necessary, top flange bracing. Bearings and supports shall allow
    for longitudinal rotation of the unit in transport and have adequate width
    and bearing capacity.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    No beam shall be transported and erected if it has a bow in excess of 1 in
    400 of the length or 75 mm whichever is the lesser. Should the bow at any
    time exceed the maximum allowable limit steps shall be taken to ensure the
    safety of the unit throughout the journey.
