    614.03 DEFINITIONS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Formwork:</strong>
    A temporary structural system comprising the form that contacts the
    concrete, and includes the supporting members, bracing and other fixtures
    used to give the required shape, lines and dimensions and to support the
    freshly placed concrete while it is setting and gaining sufficient strength
    to be self supporting.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Void Former:</strong>
    Prefabricated or solid light weight material, including associated
    anchorages and fixtures for the purpose of forming circular or irregular
    shaped voids in concrete components.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    614.04 FORMWORK DESIGN
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork shall conform to the requirements of AS 3610 and the additional
    requirements of this section.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork shall be rigid, watertight, braced and tied together to confine
    freshly placed concrete and maintain position and shape during
    construction, and shall be constructed in such a way that it can be removed
    without damage to the concrete. Where formwork is to be re-used, the
    formwork design shall allow for the deterioration of materials through use
    and handling.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The submission of formwork documentation and certification for the various
    concrete members shall be in accordance with the requirements of Table
    614.041, and Attachments A, B and C to this section.

    specifications as stated in Table 614.041, the Contractor shall submit to
    the Superintendent for review its detailed drawings and specifications of
    the proposed formwork not less than two weeks prior to the commencement of
    formwork construction.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>

    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The formwork surface material for exposed concrete surfaces shall be steel
    plate conforming to AS/NZS 1594 or plywood conforming to AS/NZS 2271,
    unless otherwise shown on the drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The type and condition of formwork sheeting and lining, and the ability of
    the formwork and its supports to withstand distortion caused by the
    placement, lateral pressure and compaction of the fresh concrete, and the
    standard of workmanship used in the formwork construction shall be such
    that a uniform concrete surface texture is produced, and the finished
    surfaces of the concrete will conform to the requirements of the
    specifications and drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All formwork panels shall be placed in a neat, symmetrical pattern such
    that the exposed panel joints do not detract from the geometry or from the
    final appearance of the structure. The proposed soffit and side formwork
    panel arrangements shall be detailed on the formwork drawings.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork panels shall be supplied in the maximum practicable width and
    length to minimise the number of joints. Plywood panels shall be placed
    with the grain of the outer plies in the direction of the span.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    614.06 FORMWORK CONSTRUCTION
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork shall be constructed and shall be of sufficient stiffness to
    tolerate the rate of concrete placement and high frequency vibration, and
    shall be of uniform stiffness to avoid causing varying vibration amplitudes
    over the formwork surfaces during compaction of the concrete. The
    constructed formwork shall be solidly braced and tight and maintain correct
    position and shape and achieve the specified dimensions, levels, cover to
    steel reinforcement and geometry of the finished structural component in
    accordance with the tolerance requirements of Section 610.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The use of wires or bolts extended to the surface of the concrete will not
    be permitted. Any embedded ties shall remain embedded and shall terminate
    not less than the minimum clear cover specified on the drawings. All
    recesses shall be filled with a shrinkage compensating cementitious mortar
    in accordance with Section 689.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Errors in line or level of the formwork, or positioning and/or quantity of
    steel reinforcement shall be corrected prior to placing concrete. The
    Contractor will be responsible for any defects to the formwork,
    reinforcement, embedded components, or the formed concrete surface, which
    may become apparent during or after casting the concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork shall not be placed in locations where steel reinforcement and
    other fixtures cannot be inspected, until evidence that the reinforcement
    and other fixtures conform to the requirements of the specifications and
    the drawings has been obtained and recorded by the Contractor.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All corners of cast-in-place or precast concrete shall have 20 mm x 20 mm
    chamfers or fillets. Chamfers and fillets shall be formed and cast
    integrally with the concrete member. Cutting or grinding of chamfers shall
    not be allowed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The interior surface of formwork shall be thoroughly cleaned out and
    treated with form oil or lubricant to prevent adhesion of the exposed
    concrete surface, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The
    form oil or lubricant shall be of the non-staining type and shall not
    discolour the surface of the concrete. The oil or lubricant shall be
    applied uniformly in a thin film and any surplus removed prior the concrete
    placement. Reinforcement and other embedments shall not be soiled by the
    form oil or lubricant.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Prior to commencement of the concreting operations all tie wire ends, wood
    chips and other debris shall be removed from the forms.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Formwork shall be sufficiently tight at joints to prevent loss of slurry or
    mortar while the concrete is in its freshly placed state, consistent with
    the method of placement and compaction. Formwork shall also be mortar tight
    where holes are needed to facilitate projecting reinforcement or fixing
    devices.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    All relevant requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004
    and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 2017 shall be satisfied with
    respect to all formwork.

    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (d) Materials
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The void formers shall be made watertight to prevent ingress of concrete
    slurry and sufficiently strong and tough to withstand handling, transport,
    storage and installation and the placing and compaction of the concrete
    without suffering damage or deformation. Void formers and associated
    fixtures shall remain dimensionally stable and retain their physical
    properties under normal conditions of use, shall be resistant to fire,
    shall not cause staining or discolouration and shall not alter physically
    or chemically by contact with concrete slurry or moisture.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    As a minimum solid formers shall be rigid cellular expanded polystyrene
    complying with Class S as stated in AS 1366.3.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (e) Fabrication
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Void formers shall be fabricated such that after the concreting operations
    they maintain correct position and shape and achieve the specified
    dimensions, levels and geometry of the finished structural component in
    accordance with the specified tolerance requirements.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Any stiffening ribs of prefabricated void formers shall project inwards to
    ensure a smooth outer surface profile and seams shall be watertight,
    recessed to present a smooth outer surface and mechanically overlocked when
    fabricated from spirally-wound strip material. Joints to any fixtures shall
    be sealed and watertight.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Void formers and associated fixtures shall not be dented, cracked, spalled
    or porous, exhibiting signs of corrosion or are otherwise damaged in any
    way prior to installation, to prevent local instability of the void former
    under pressure from the wet concrete.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Void formers shall be fabricated to the following tolerances:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (i) outside dimension/diameter to within &#177; 3 mm (for cylindrical
    formers diameters measured at right angles);
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (ii) overall length, with required fixtures in place to within + 0 to - 20
    mm;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iii) diagonal dimensions for solid void formers to within &#177; 3 mm;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (iv) for horizontal bow the deviation of the void former from the required
    profile shall not exceed 0.06% of the length of the void former or a
    maximum of 8 mm.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<br clear="all"/>
<p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) Installation
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The void former shall be securely restrained in position during and after
    the concreting operations. Large uplift forces acting as a result of the
    buoyancy effect and any lateral pressure due to concrete placement shall be
    resisted by external means and not by securing the void former to the steel
    reinforcement.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Joints between void former segments shall be watertight.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The tolerance on final position of the void former at any location shall be
    within &#177; 7 mm.
    <p>
