<p>
    This section covers the design, construction and removal of cofferdams.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A cofferdam is an open-topped temporary structure for the purpose of
    providing a safe workplace for undertaking construction activities in
    water. Cofferdams may be constructed from steel sheet-piling or from
    pre-cast reinforced concrete and may be framed internally.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The construction of caissons (fully enclosed and submerged temporary
    structures) is outside of the scope of this document.

<p>
    603.02 STANDARDS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Design and construction of cofferdams shall comply with the requirements of
    relevant Australian Standards. Section 175 provides a list of current
    companion documents referenced in the VicRoads Standard Specifications for
    Roadworks and Bridgeworks.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    In circumstances where AS 5100 and AS 2159 requirements differ, the
    requirements of AS 5100.3 shall take precedence over those of AS 2159.
