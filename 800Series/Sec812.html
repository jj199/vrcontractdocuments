<p>
    <strong>
        This section covers the production requirements for crushed rock
        produced from a variety of raw feed sources including quarries, crushed
        concrete, Newer Basalt Surface Spalls (NBSS) and blended crushed rock
        mixes containing supplementary materials.
        <p>
        </p>

    <strong>
        Crushed Rock
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    A crushed rock is a material composed of graded coarse and fine aggregate
    components produced by the crushing, scalping and screening of a raw rock
    feed source, Newer Basalt Surface Spalls (NBSS) and/or crushed concrete,
    and may also be a blend of components which includes limited quantities of
    supplementary materials.

    <strong>
        Crushed Rock Class
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    For the purpose of this specification, Crushed Rock products are to be
    supplied in various classes broadly defined as follows:
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Class 1 </strong>
    is a premium cohesive pavement base material for unbound pavements where a
    very high standard of surface preparation for a sprayed sealed or thin
    asphalt surfacing is required. It has a minimum plasticity index
    requirement and will likely have additional requirement for maximum
    permeability when used for heavy duty unbound pavements.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Class 2 </strong>
    is a high quality pavement base material for unbound flexible pavements in
    locations where a very high standard of surface preparation may not be
    required. Class 2 crushed rock product does not have a minimum plasticity
    index or a maximum permeability requirement. Recycled materials are
    permitted for Class 2 crushed rock.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Class 3</strong>
    is a high quality upper subbase material for heavy duty unbound flexible
    pavements. It may have a minimum permeability requirement to provide
    positive drainage to the sub-surface drains and overlying unbound pavement
    layer. Where specified, Class 3 may be used as base for lightly trafficked
    pavements provided the material produces sufficient cohesive fines during
    compaction. Recycled materials are permitted for Class 3 crushed rock.
    <strong>
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Class 4 </strong>
    is a lower subbase material for heavy duty unbound and/or bound pavements
    or a subbase material for most other types of pavements. It may have a
    maximum permeability requirement. Recycled materials are permitted for
    Class 4 crushed rock.

    <strong>Plant Mixed Wet&#8209;Mix Crushed Rock (PMWMCR)</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Plant mixed wet&#8209;mix crushed rock is a mixture of crushed rock and
    water, produced at a controlled mixing plant to close tolerances of
    moisture content based on the modified optimum moisture content of the
    material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Recycled Material
        <p>
        </p>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Materials obtained from a construction and/or demolition site which are
    crushed and re-processed to produce a crushed rock or a supplementary
    material.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Supplementary Material</strong>
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    A durable material added to a crushed rock to improve the workability and
    physical properties.

    812.03 MATERIAL SOURCE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Crushed rock manufactured at a quarry or non-quarry site shall not be used
    until the material source has been investigated and accredited in
    accordance with VicRoads Code of Practice for Source Investigations
    RC500.00 as listed in Section 175.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Material sources used in the production of crushed rock shall comply with

    Mixes which do not comply in all respects with the requirements of the Code
    of Practice but which are considered appropriate for use subject to
    conditions attached to the registration.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Expired </strong>

    Where the grading of the supplied crushed rock varies by more than + or -

    BASE/SUBBASE
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    After completion of manufacture, but before compaction, Classes 1, 2, 3 and
    4 crushed rock and PMWMCR base/subbase shall comply with the relevant
    grading requirements (% passing and where specified retained on each sieve)
    of VicRoads Code of Practice RC500.02 as listed in Section 175.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The crushed rock grading shall not extend from the coarse limit on one
    sieve to the fine limit on the following sieve or vice versa.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Unless otherwise advised as a part of the crushed rock mix registration
    process, the initial target grading shall be at or near the centre of the
    specified grading envelope. The target grading may be varied from time to
    time to achieve the specified post compaction grading contained in Section
    304. The specified grading limits shall remain unchanged regardless of the
    target grading.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Class 4 subbase of a different nominal size to that specified may be
    accepted by the Superintendent, provided it meets the grading requirements
    for the nominal size as described in VicRoads Code of Practice RC500.02.

    812.08 ADDITION OF WATER
    <p>

</p>
<p>
    Water added to the crushed rock products either onsite or in PMWMCR shall
    be clean and substantially free from detrimental impurities such as oils,
    salts, acids, alkalis and vegetable substances. Water sources shall be
    tested for electrical conductivity and pH, in accordance with the current
    Australian Standards as listed in Section 175. The electrical conductivity
    shall not be more than 3500 &#181;S/cm and pH within the range of 6 to 10,
    unless otherwise approved by VicRoads.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The use of reclaimed water will require the approval of the Superintendent
and shall conform to VicRoads guidelines for reclaimed water -    <em>Integrated Water Management Guidelines</em> as listed under other
    referenced documents in Section 175.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water sources added to crushed rock shall be tested at a maximum of twelve
    monthly intervals during the course of supply or when the nature of the
    water source has changed.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    Water sources classified by the relevant water authority as potable water
    shall be exempt from the above requirements.

<p>
    (a) the product, after recovery from the stockpile, complies with this
    specification;

    (b) the stockpile site is clean, adequately paved, and well drained;
    <p>

    (c) if a stockpile is constructed in more than one layer, each layer is
    fully contained within the area occupied by the upper surface of the
    preceding layer;

    content of 3.5% by mass;

    (e) all PMWMCR delivered to stockpile shall be supplied at a moisture
    content of not less than OMC unless the material is to be wet mixed again
    prior to delivery to the roadbed where the minimum moisture content in
    stockpile shall be not less than 3.5% by mass;
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    (f) the surface of the stockpile shall be kept damp to prevent a net loss
    of moisture and to minimise the generation of airborne dust.

    812.12 MINIMUM TESTING REQUIREMENTS
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The Contractor shall test crushed rock products and PMWMCR at such a
    frequency to ensure that the supplied material consistently complies with
    the specified requirements of VicRoads Standard Sections, Code of Practice
    500.02 and any additional testing specified as a condition of registration
    of the crushed rock mix.
    <p>
    </p>
</p>
<p>
    The test frequency shall initially not be less than that shown in Table
    812.121, except that the test frequency for Grading, Plasticity Index,
    Unsound Rock Content, pH and Conductivity, and Degradation Factor, may be
    halved where the most recent ten successive test results meet the specified
    requirements. If any subsequent test result fails, another test shall be
    immediately undertaken. If the second test fails the test frequency shall
    revert to the minimum test frequency specified in Table 812.121 and the
    Contractor shall not return to half the test frequency until a further ten
    successive test results comply with the specified requirements.
